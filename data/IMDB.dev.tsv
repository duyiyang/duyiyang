the youthful group in st elmo's fire who just graduated from college barely seem able to make it through high school much less four years at any prominent university for the most part these kids are irresponsible selfish greedy and stupid yet co writer and director joel schumacher appears to hold them up as touchstones for a generation with a now outdated cast of up and comers a background score that sounds awfully similar to that of terms of endearment and writing which lords the smugness of this circle over us fire is a paltry blaze one that gets even more embarrassing as the years pass on 1 2 from	negative
horrible film about an old crusty painter who hangs around with a young girl boring tatum o neil goes through the motions in her part and has some of the corniest lines in film history richard burton looks close to death in this film and we're supposed to believe he looks good for sixty the acting is bad as is the plot the characters are awful as is the story it's really hard to feel for anyone in this film except larry ewashen who plays a guy in a porno theater who hits on tatum he's kind of funny this movie is really a waste of time if you are a tatum fan like me which is why i rented it in the first place please don't see this movie she is really bad in it and you'll wonder if maybe paper moon was a fluke it wasn't because of bad news bears and little darlings it's known she can act well but still don't rent this movie and if you're a fan of burton rent something when he was good looking and not a fossil	negative
this one is a bit more stylish than the average erotic thriller and peta wilson is a very sexy presence but it plays like they lost a few pages of script somewhere subplots come in and out of nowhere the connections between some of the characters are murky and the killer's motivation is unclear to say the least maybe they could get away with this in a porn version but here some more clarification is needed	negative
what made the french connection work so well was the relationship between doyle hackman and russo scheider in this catastrophe directed by frankenheimer who also brought us such gems as raindeer games and the island of dr moreau the movie focuses on doyle and his singular obsession of capturing charnier rey the fictitious idea that the nypd would allow doyle to travel to marseilles to find charnier with the help of the french local authorities is laugh out loud funny correct me if i'm wrong but didn't charnier skip town with 65 pounds of pure smack a street value of 32 million but yeah let's send doyle to find this guy it was his pinch after all please the story was weak the acting was terrible with the lone exception of hackman who completely overplayed his part the direction was all over the place even the cuts between scenes were terrible do yourself a favor and watch the first installment twice and skip this one	negative
assy mcgee is an out of control hard nosed detective based on the countless examples from late 20th century police dramas the twist here is that assy is literally a walking buttocks the cheap low brow facade of the show belies its cleverness and hidden satire that is not to say that assy is devoid of fart jokes just that the toilet humor is used sparingly enough to elicit consistent laughs not groans and eye rolls the title sequence of the program demonstrates the clever subtle humor used throughout the sequence consists of panning photos of the city set to a jazzy 70s cop theme in one photo a police cruiser is shown and the camera zooms in on the front license plate holder which is vacant the meaningless zoom in satirizes the production of the typical 70s 80s cop drama and incidentally makes me laugh every time all the typical characters are included the frustrated police chief who can't control assy the loyal minority partner who acts as a foil to assy's recklessness the regular cops who detest assy's means all are accounted for and all are hilarious satires of the typical police drama the voice acting primarily performed by larry murphy is nothing less than spectacular assy's voice breathy and gruff with a bit of a drunken slur is so clever and unique that it ranks alongside all time greats like stewie griffin family guy and homer simpson simpsons though the voice is slurred the diction is somehow clear and easy to understand this is a nice change from other adult swim program voices that often require closed captioning to understand besides the fantastic production and voice acting the script is also hilarious assy's no nonsense directness fuels most of the humor particularly in his interactions with citizens outside the police force if you have access to the adult swim comedies assy mcgee is certainly worth the watching each episode clocks in at a mere 8 9 minutes so you really have little to lose	positive
set in the 1794 the second year of the french republic formed after the execution of louis xvi this film portrays the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders danton gerard depardieu at his finest and robespierre a commanding performance by the polish actor wojciech pszoniak the moderate revolutionary danton has returned to paris from his country seat where he has been since being deposed as leader of the committee of public safety in the previous year by robespierre he is opposed to the reign of terror which has resulted in the executions of thousands of citizens mainly by guillotine who are thought to be opposed to the revolution danton is confident of the support of the ordinary people and tries to persuade robespierre to curb the bloodletting but robespierre and the committee are afraid that the popularity of danton will lead to them being overthrown and put danton and his supporters on trial for being traitors this was the first french language film made by andrzej wajda after he had arrived in france from poland his polish film company was closed down by the government due to his support for the solidarity trade union which had opposed the polish government in the late seventies and early eighties his previous film man of iron 1981 had dealt with the solidarity union and its leader lech walesa and it is easy to draw comparisons between the relationship of walesa and the polish leader general jaruselski and that between danton and robespierre danton walesa are the voice of reason opposed to robespierre jaruselski who continue dictatorial rule despite having lost the support of the people they claim to represent the film is based on the polish play the danton affair written by stanislawa przybyszewska in the 1930s and on its release the film was criticised by some for being static and theatrical but what the film does is to concentrate on the behind the scenes meetings of the committees and the scenes in the national assembly and the courtroom rather than the activities on the streets of paris	positive
this movie is perfect for families to watch together it is a great film and it deserves more credit the special effects are stunning and spectacular everyone who has children should share this with theirs	positive
ok i'm normally pretty open minded about movies i can normally see a good side to a film which has been totally pandered by others this is an exception i won't waste to much energy telling you what happens but think along the lines of bill and ted meets the worst police academy movie out of all of them and you won't be far off the thing that really got me about this film was the stupid purile racism that was evident throughout the general theme of latino black guys cool white guys lame is slightly amusing for the first couple of jokes but when the same joke has been reiterated for the 500th time not an exageration by the way it gets both tiresome and offensive i spent months waiting for the laws of karma to get back at john leguizamo for this film i had almost given up hope when the 'my vh1 awards' were screened live in the uk what followed was mr leguizamo performing the rare feat of a comedian bombing on stage you'd have to be a complete sadist to laugh at him ahem ha ha ha	negative
a coming of age story about a teenager rebelling against the church and her minister father in a small norwegian village the countryside setting is picturesque but the story is rather pretentious and plodding with much of the film devoted to quoting scriptures it's like watching a religious propaganda movie theisen who has made only one other movie is pretty good as the sensitive young protagonist as are sundquist as her strict father and riise as a woman that theisen is fascinated with the film aims to be fresh and charming but feels rather stale and tired director and co writer nesheim who has worked mostly in tv is not up to the task	negative
having just seen walt disney's the skeleton dance on the saturday morning blog as linked from youtube i used those same sources to watch a remake done in technicolor for the columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same man ub iwerks the colors compared to the earlier black and white are really used imaginatively here and many of the new gags like when one of the skeletal band players hits a wrong note constantly or when one loses his head and takes another one's off or when one dances with the other with part of that other gone are just as funny as the previous short it does get a little repetitious near the end still skeleton frolics is well worth seeing for any animation buff who wants to compare this with the earlier silly symphony	positive
awful in a bad good way this movie has officially become the worst made for tv movie in my book except for the camp value it offers i give it a 1 in quality and a 10 for the camp value suggestion watch with friends champagne and plenty of popcorn you'll want to throw some at the screen preferably friends who like chris noth from his 'sex in the city days' this movie is dreadfully funny this is definitely the lowest point in the careers of all cast members honestly i don't know how they controlled the laughter as the lines were delivered daniel j travanti is absolutely pathetic everyone participated in the school of over acting and poor joan van ark i believe she was the only one taking this theater of the absurd seriously she is credited as a producer though her mom jeans and bad plastic surgery are scene stealer's this movie also crosses the oh so delicate line of social incorrectness when they introduce a mentally challenged character into the plot this is an obscure movie showing on lifetime listed as with harmful intent has anyone else had the pleasure	negative
maléfique is an example of how a horror film can be effective with nothing more than a well executed plot and a lot of heart its cast doesn't have recognized names it doesn't have a big budget and it certainly lacks in the visual effects aspect but it compensates all that with an intelligent and well written script an effective cast and the vision of a director focused more on telling the story than in delivering cheap thrills eric valette may not be a well know name yet but with maléfique his feature length debut he proves he is at the level of contemporaries like jeunet gans or aja the film is the story of four prisoners in a cell four different men with very different backgrounds but with one single goal to get out carrère gérald laroche gets imprisoned after being declared guilty of a multi millionaire fraud his cell mates the violent marcus clovis cornillac the intellectual lassalle philippe laudenbach and the mentally challenged pâquerette dimitri rataud are all convicted for murder and give carrère a cold welcome their personalities will clash as carrère discovers an ancient book detailing how a former prisoner escaped using black magic written by alexandre charlo and franck magnier maléfique is a great mix of dark fantasy and horror in a way very reminiscent of clive barker's stories the movie's strongest point is the way it builds up the characters they are all have very complex and different personalities and a lot of the tension and suspense comes from their constant clash of personalities the story's supernatural element is very well handled and overall gives the film the feeling of reading a gothic novel despite being a movie about four men locked in a room the movie never gets boring or tiresome and in fact the isolation of the group increases the feeling of distrust claustrophobia and specially paranoia director eric valette makes a great use of atmosphere mood and his cast to give life to the plot despite its obvious lack of budget he has crafted a brilliant film that feels original fresh and very attractive his subtle and effective camera work helps to make the film dynamic despite its single location and the slow pace the film unfolds is excellent to create the heavy atmosphere of isolation and distrust the movie bases its plot the very few displays of special effects are very well done and valette trades quantity for quality in the few but terrific scenes of gore the characters are what make this film work and the cast definitely deserves some of the credit gérald laroche is excellent as carrère a man at first sight innocent but who hides a dark past philippe laudenbach and dimitri rataud are very effective too specially rataud in his very demanding role however is clovis cornillac who steal the show with his performance as marcus a violent and disturbed man who deep inside only wants to be himself the characters are superbly developed and the cast makes the most of them the movie is terrific but it is not without its share of flaws of course the most notorious one is its the low budget some of the cgi effects are a bit poor compared to the effective make up and prosthetics used in other scenes however it is never too bad for it probably the bad thing about maléfique is that it seems to lose some steam by the end when it focuses on the supernatural black magic rather than in the characters not too much of a bad thing but the ending may seem weak from that point of view anyways maléfique is another one of those great horror films coming out from france lately and one that deserves to have more recognition valette is definitely a talent to follow as this modest albeit complex tale of the supernatural is prove enough of his abilities personally this film is a new favorite 8 10	positive
chaplin enters the trenches of wwi in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war the rain the mud the explosions all these things are present but chaplin seems strangely oblivious to them all he's in france for one thing to fight the germans something he does with unbelievable success it almost seems like an extended ego trip for chaplin a very funny one at that until the final minute when it rises to a new level of poignancy and everything makes sense perhaps it's what all soldiers dream of before the go to war	positive
this movie can be described in those 2 words just unbelievable this is the best movie ever made i just cant see why this movie isnt in the top 250 i also can't see why anybody would not love scarface anyways if you havnt seen it it is a must buy	positive
when you think 'oliver stone' the movies that come to mind would be his biggest and most controversial ones like platoon jfk born on the fourth of july or natural born killers talk radio usually doesn't it's a pretty small movie actually more than half the movie takes place with barry champlain at his radio station talking into his mike but believe me this is one of oliver stone's greatest movies and should not be missed above all things it's a character study barry champlain is a rude self destructive risk taking talk radio show host who says one too many things and starts to get in trouble with his boss his lover s his fans and even some nazis he doesn't like his audience and callers and a lot of them don't like him eithor that or do like him but have no idea why but at the end he says on his show i guess we're stuck with each other see talk radio even if you don't like oliver stone movies you might be surprised i sure was my rating 10 10	positive
this is a great movie if viewed in the proper context it was meant to be a parody of teen horror devil worship movies and the '80s saw plenty of them i saw this movie when it first came out and instantly liked it being a big fan of kiss it was great to see gene in the movie and anything with ozzy as a metal hating preacher can't be all bad also fastway was already a favorite of mine so it was great to hear them on the soundtrack the original vhs this was pre dvd cover for trick or treat featured an illustration of sammi kneeling playing his guitar in a ring of fire with a demon looking on it was a special order and the price for the vhs copy at the time circa 1987 was 90 i really wanted the movie but not at that ridiculous price the 'ozzy gene' cover was only created for the 5 re release the company releasing it probably figured gene and ozzy were the only recognizable people in the movie so they had better put 'em on the cover same thing with the original little shop of horrors jack nicholson was in it for all of five minutes but now they have him on the cover as if he were the main star i have a trick or treat web site and it's surprising how many people believe sammi curr was a real person fastway helped perpetuate that myth by dedicating their soundtrack album to 'sammi curr' all in all it was just a good time rock n roll movie definitely not to be taken too seriously but just enjoyed	positive
i knew as soon as i saw the first trailer for black snake moan that i would have to see it i was not disappointed in the slightest in the film which was written and directed by hustle and flow's creator craig brewer it tells the story of a broken blues man and the nymphomaniac he aims to cure not just for her sake but also his own yet it's so much more than that it's complex and rich and it manages to steep you in a gritty sticky sultry blue memphis without making you feel like you need a bath afterward the characters are for the most part multifaceted and very well written and performed the accents and the dialogue were carried off flawlessly however there was one weak link in the chain justin timberlake the best i can say for him is that he can pull off crying it's a rare male actor who can cry convincingly however justin's ronnie was flat but as an actor he was trying very hard i would definitely give him another chance lazarus and rae samuel l jackson and christina ricci respectively have a great chemistry and a great respect for each other this is one of those films where it doesn't matter how good one actor is if the other one isn't up to the task and luckily both of the actors were up to the task the music was very bit as good as you would expect especially when mr samuel l jackson sings the blues phenomenal on the technical side all was brilliance as far as i could see it was well edited well shot and well mixed everything was great the character and set designs were just right the casting of the supporting characters even justin timberlake and especially kim richards was spot on loved it	positive
having just seen the a perfect spy mini series in one go one can do nothing but doff one's hat a pure masterpiece which compared to the other le carré minis about smiley has quite different qualities in the minis about smiley it is alex guiness as smiley who steals the show the rest of the actors just support him one can say here it is ensemble and story that's important as the lead actor played excellently by peter egan in the final episodes isn't charismatic at all egan just plays a guy called magnus pym who by lying being devious and telling people what they like to hear is very well liked by everyone big and small the only one who seems to understand his inner self is alex his czech handler never have the machinery behind a spy and or traitor been told better after having followed his life from a very young age we fully understand what it is that makes it possible to turn him into a traitor his ability to lie and fake everything is what makes him into 'a perfect spy' as his czech handler calls him and by following his life we fully understand how difficult it is to get back to the straight and narrow path once you've veered off it he trundles on even if he never get anything economic out of it except promotion by his mi5 spy masters everyone's happy as long as the flow of faked information continues magnus's father played wonderfully by ray mcanally is a no good con man who always dreams up schemes to con people out of their money in later years it is his son who has to bail him out again and again but by the example set by his dad and uncle who takes over as guardian when his father goes to prison and his mom is sent off to an asylum magnus quickly learns early that lying is the way of surviving not telling the truth at first he overdoes it a bit but quickly learn to tell the right lies and to be constant not changing the stories from time to time that he tell those who want to listen about himself and his dad his czech handler alex expertly played by rüdiger weigang creates with the help of magnus a network of non existing informants which supplies the british mi5 with fake information for years and years just as the british did with the german spies that were active in the uk before and during the war they kept on sending fake information to das vaterland long after the agents themselves had been turned liquidated or simply been replaced by mi5 men the young lads who play magnus in younger years does it wonderfully and most of them are more charismatic than the older little more cynic and tired pym played by egan but you buy the difference easily as that is often the way we change through life from enthusiasm to sorrow or indifference indeed well worth the money	positive
i found the movie very interesting i really enjoyed the film the actors were great it was entertainment benny the uncle was wonderful he was real at his character the ending took a wonderful twist i would recommend you seeing it eddie mores girlfriend reminded me a little of sandra bullock she was sharp as a nail i also like the little girls acting in the movie she was very convincing benny reminded me of a friend of mine who really lives his life growing up in brooklyn i loved the scene where he tasted the sauce in the pot because thats how most people cook lol i actually watched the movie 2 times and learned more the second time	positive

i just took my 11 year old daughter and 8 year old son to this movie and i can't remember a movie where i laughed so hard literal out loud deep bursts of laughter because this movie is hilarious granted the story line is predictable but the ride is so extremely enjoyable it doesn't matter that you know how it's going to end the actors' comedic senses of timing were impeccable the actors were perfectly cast my children mentioned that amanda bynes seems to be the last of the young women actresses who aren't ruining their lives she is so refreshing my children said this is now their favorite movie of 2006 our money was well spent on this movie	positive

being a transplanted new yorker i might be more critical than most in watching city hall but i have to say that before even getting to the story itself i was captivated by the location shooting and the political atmosphere of new york city that director harold becker created for example there's a reference to woerner's restaurant in brooklyn where political boss frank anselmo likes to eat there is or was a woerner's restaurant on remsen street in downtown brooklyn when i lived in new york back in 1996 it was in fact particularly favored by political people in the borough though they did have a couple of other hangouts no surprise because the script was co authored by nicholas pileggi who still writes both political and organized crime stories he knows the atmosphere quite well and he sure knows how those two worlds cross as they do in this film a detective played by nestor serrano goes for an unofficial meeting with a relative of mob boss anthony franciosa and things erupt and three people wind up dead including an innocent 6 year old boy whose father was walking him to school the story mushrooms and at the end it's reached inside city hall itself al pacino plays mayor john pappas and john cusack is his deputy mayor a transplanted louisianan a state which has a tradition of genteel corruption itself he's the outsider here and in trying to do damage control cusack finds more than he bargained for danny aiello plays brooklyn political boss frank anselmo and for those of you not from new york his character is based on the late borough president of queens donald manes who was also brought down by scandal he's very much the kind of brooklyn politician i knew back in the day whose friendship with organized crime and favors done for them do aiello in city hall was the farewell performance on film for anthony franciosa one of the most underrated and under appreciated talents ever on the screen no one watches anyone else whenever he's on al pacino's best moment is when at the funeral of the young child killed he takes over the proceedings and turns it into a political triumph for himself his is a complex part he's a decent enough man but one caught up in the corruption it takes to rise in a place like new york for those who want to know about political life in the big apple city hall is highly recommended	positive
charlie wilson's war based on a true story tells the tale of a texas congressman and a cia agent working to secure funding for covert support of the mujaheddin in 1980s afghanistan following the ussr invasion of the country this conflict played a major role in the final years of the cold war between the us and the ussr in terms of film making charlie wilson's war is a definite winner it well written well acted and well shot while most of the attention has gone to tom hanks for yet another fine performance i was even more impressed with philip seymour hoffman's turn as cia operative gust avrakotos scenes of soviet attacks on under armed villages and of the refugee camp effectively tug at the heart the film also gives a good behind the scenes look at the wheeling and dealing that congressman wilson must go through to secure the desired funding there are however two complaints i have about the film the first is that there is a subplot involving an scandal investigation that is not well developed and as such only serves as a minor distraction to the story line the second complaint is that the film lacks some of the context of the war the film makes the mujaheddin look like innocent victims and while they did suffer large civilian casualties the mujaheddin were in fact rebels trying to topple the government of afghanistan this government ignored entirely in the film not surprisingly fought to suppress the rebellion later calling on the soviet union for support in their effort the film also ignores that the us was aiding the mujaheddin prior to the soviet deployment in afghanistan the film did hint at the unintended consequences of our covert actions consequences we are still feeling today but it seems as if screenwriter aaron sorkin and director mike nichols were willing to sacrifice some historical context to provide a cohesive narrative not having read the book i do not know if george crile made the same compromise those complaints notwithstanding i did enjoy watching charlie wilson's war and do recommend it i would have preferred a film that more accurately depicted the complexities of the situation as stephen gaghan did in syriana but the audiences connected better with cohesive narrative of charlie wilson's war than with the ambiguities present in syriana	positive
i'm giving this film 9 out of 10 only because there aren't enough specific scientific references to the amount of energy it takes to produce food to satisfy the science haters mdixon seems to believe the admittedly biased commentators are making this stuff up but even an elementary understanding of resources and the laws of thermodynamics will indicate that at the very least they are on solid scientific ground when they state that we cannot continue to depend on oil we must transition to different types of energy and do not have a plan that will replace the amount of energy we get from oil other civilizations have refused to face the facts of life and have perished read jared diamond's collapse which is a popular book or any elementary ecology or earth science textbook and you can verify the basic premise of this movie go ahead fiddle while rome burns	positive
i recently rented twister a movie i'd seen several years ago on tv and it has aged well i found myself laughing out loud several times at it and as weird as all these people are by the end i profoundly cared about them this is the sort of little movie that is made for a cult audience because rather like howdy's gazpacho well i think that's what it is it's an acquired taste you have to be attuned to its peculiar wavelength the production values might be charitably called inexpensive and the pace and atmosphere take a while to get settled but the film has a look especially in some wonderful shots contrasting the dry flatness of the land with the cluttery nouveau riche opulence of the mansion interior michael almereyda had a good eye even then life with sodapop magnate eugene cleveland harry dean stanton and his household two adult children a grandchild and a housekeeper seems so detached from life outside we could be in gormenghast everyone in this film is wonderful especially suzy amis and crispin glover as the directionless genius siblings maureen and howdy inhabiting their roles so comfortably after a while you just buy the strange premise that somehow having survived the tornado and being apparently incapable of happiness these people are lucky and yet don't know quite what to do with their luck there are some truly great scenes eugene's sudden confrontations first with his gold digging children's tv host girlfriend virginia an acidly pert lois chiles then with his children william s burroughs taking target practice in the barn and telling a story about a mysterious jim maureen's boyfriend chris proving himself by battling a shed full of wasps cloaked in a tablecloth and doily and old fedora howdy violet maureen and chris all sitting on the couch the latter three in appropriately lightweight summer garments the former in a red blazer and black leather rock'n'roll gear staring at images of deserts on the huge tv and contemplating the future the images were done by bill viola who did the backdrop video installation for nine inch nails' last tour crispin glover is predictably magnificent as howdy as always he remains perfectly in character howdy has made a cult of his misery and brilliance he's like the oscar wilde of kansas striving to live up to his red velvet suit whether he's thrashing away tunelessly yet loudly on an electric guitar cracking a fullsize bullwhip while wearing an all black cowboy outfit demolishing a room or even doing simple things like driving or pouring the aforementioned soup from a blender pitcher he's mesmerizing if you like his work you'll like this	positive
don't get me wrong i enjoy art house movies low budget flicks character studies and foreign movies unfortunately i couldn't enjoy this one glacial pacing complete lack of plot and characters that you can't dislike enough to hate but you can't tolerate enough to like for me distant was like watching the cutting room floor footage of a reality show all of the scenes which were deemed too uninteresting which would normally not make the final cut were the only scenes included a camera in my apartment with two of my friends ambling around for hours does not an interesting movie make distant certainly makes the watcher feel that way long stretches of no dialogue nearly 10 minutes before the first word is spoken from the credits can be made to work 2001 comes to mind but for me something else compelling needs to happen to draw me in if you're the kind of watcher who can sit through a movie and be content with movie analysis perhaps it will work for you however if you're somebody who chooses to watch movies to relax expand your mind or be entertained you should probably look elsewhere	negative

not having seen this film in quite some time we caught with it not long ago in the nicely transferred criterion dvd le cercle rouge is a film that owes a lot to other movies as it keeps reminding us about rififi the asphalt jungle among others because they all deal with capers that take center stage in the movie and reproduce it in great detail unfortunately one knows that old adage that crime does not pay and from the start these men involved in it are doomed from the onset jean pierre melville was a director of few words he didn't fill his pictures with a lot of dialog as it's the case here yet for not being talky they had a style of their own as proved with le dolous le samurai and his masterpiece bob le flambeur among others mr melville had a sense of style that comes across in everything he did in this film working with his cinematographer henri decae he takes us along for a ride through the streets of paris that shows the vibrant city mainly at night and the bleak winter in france the score is by eric demarsan that emphasizes a jazzy music that accompanies most of the action although the film shows alain delon as corey at the center of the action it is however the smart inspector mattei who is the real hero of the movie as played by the great bourvil he is a man that shows a lot of patience because he has figured from the beginning how to catch vogel and in the process he gets involved in the investigation of the jewel heist in which he knows the escaped man he is tailing looms large behind it bourvil gives an enormously satisfying performance as mattei showing equal parts of determination and tenderness as it's the case with the three cats he adores alain delon always responded with interesting performances his appearances in mellville's pictures in here he is corey the man who is first seen leaving prison and promising himself he won't go back but he cannot pass a good thing when he decides to go ahead and participate in the robbery his association with vogel and jansen pays off in the way they get the job done but it will also prove a mistake in the way they will not be able to dispose of the loot as the fence they have relied on has a change of heart gian maria volonte and yves montand are seen as vogel and jansen respectively they were excellent actors who blend well in the action of the film both actors were at their best moment when they took the roles in the film and it shows mr montand has the more complex character to play as we witness him in his first moment in front of the camera as a man with many demons inside his head jean pierre mellville got wonderful results from his cast and crew in a film that although feels a bit longer but still succeeds in showing his style in one of the most memorable pictures from the director	positive
what makes midnight cowboy into a successful movie is the way in which joe buck becomes bonded to ratso rizzo through a series of hardships that affect them both there really aren't many glimpses of hope in this film for either character but the hard realities that beset them both give the film its own type of optimism that these men can at least find humanity within each other this film features jon voight's finest performance and probably dustin hoffman's as well the rest of the cast is made up of unknowns though it is rounded out by a fine series of character actors including the cowpoke on the bus at the start of the film also for those interested andy warhol's apprentice paul morrissey shows up briefly during the party scene if you haven't seen this movie it is essential check it out	positive

marigold is by far the best outsider's take on bollywood i have ever seen i didn't grow up with bollywood but i've seen a few hundred of them now i'd say it leaves gurinder chadha mira nair and even merchant and ivory of bombay talkie almost in the dust willard carroll the director really loves bollywood and he has the self confidence to allow us to know it there's humor but no arch ironic distancing no of course i don't really mean this stuff as jerry lee lewis would say he gets it and so he can let us have it too the joy of a bollywood movie experience along with touches that are supplied by a westerner's stepping into the story teller's role it's a story about a caustic bitchy beautiful american b movie actress she's only been in movies with numbers in their titles like fatal attraction 3 who finds herself in a different bollywood movie from the one she went to india to be in kama sutra 3 has folded its tents while she was en route apparently because its producers are now in jail salman khan in real life a bollywood mega mega star is the dancing master of the delightful written on the fly movie she has now been pulled into is this before or after i go blind and through the sweetness of his mildly psychically gifted character she learns more than how to find her inner ecstatic dancing ability the strong beginning gives you both bollywood a super energetic troupe of dancers in front of the taj mahal both funny an familiar to the western viewer as well as providing the high velocity musical thrill we love in a hindi movie and salman on screen from the outset no bollywood 20 minute wait for the hero he has on an indian costume embellished with kit carson style western movie fringe all in white ali larter's actress character is pleasing to the western viewer she's blonde which is traditional for a white person in a bollywood movie and visually understandable casting but she's a robust girl not the ethereal kind of blondie we're usually presented with and she's a more or less three dimensional total bitch carrying on profane and abusive cell phone conversations with a boyfriend and agent in the us we also have scenes of women who are having problems with each other going out to a bar to deal with them the capacity for people not getting along to relate and have emotional conversations is traditional in hindi movies but we seldom see much of any such thing going on between women other than the discussion between mother and daughter about the daughter's choice of groom let alone strangers unrelated people let alone bar going so the spirit is the same the details are fresh and i was completely delighted by this i only saw it once at a preview showing attended by the director a fine speaker and question answerer he and salman got to be brother like good friends over the making of it he loves india he has plans to make a wizard of oz movie in india i can't get too detailed about songs when i've seen them just once except to say i liked them all they range from a happy parody of the bollywood number in the movie within the movie the ladies' costumes with leghorn hats and seashell cased bodices it's a beach scene on flowy dresses are worth the cost of a ticket alone to a lovely reflective many scened romantic song in a sadder and more serious part of the movie mix of hindi and english in the music and it works salman khan gets a lot of credit from me for openness to unusual projects this and jaan e mann and good judgment about which ones to be in carroll said he was full of suggestions and ideas all along the way and totally fine i e not narcissistic at all whether carroll accepted or rejected them clearly just a pro who loves being involved and collaborating	positive
i've never been huge on imax films they're cool but once you get over that initial rush of whoa it feels like flying the movies themselves are usually pretty corny and ordinary the exceptions have been the powerful everest the exhilarating wild california and now the bbc's the human body a super sized look at the insides of our bodies our bodies are machines of a complexity that is simply inconceivable this 50 minute film could be 10 hours long and still wouldn't get to all of the systems working in tandem just as i type this review and listen to my radio and most of us take it all for granted here you can see the inside of a pumping heart looks like an alien spaceship the inside of your lungs the tiny hairs in your eardrum that process sound the development of a baby inside a mother's womb and surprisingly a few of the um less attractive functions that i thought it would shy away from pimples the churning of acids in the stomach this film also has a rather funky style to it which sets it apart from other imax documentaries for instance we've all seen sperm finding its way to the egg but have you ever seen it set to the tune of marvin gaye's let's get it on it's creative moments like that that make the human body not just a health lesson but fun as well	positive
despite loving rita hayworth finding the final few sequences of the film intriguing and being able to appreciate some of the subtler symbolic aspects of the cinematography the lady from shanghai didn't quite work for me i had a problem with most of the performances the script and the overall structure and in a film that's mostly people talking with each other in various situations that's quite a problem the lady from shanghai ended up at a very low c or a 7 for me the lady from shanghai is really all about orson welles' character michael o'hara o'hara sees elsa rosalie bannister rita hayworth in central park on a carriage ride and hits on her later he saves her from a mugging and she takes a shine to him o'hara is a seaman from ireland and the globetrotting elsa happens to own a yacht with her husband arthur everett sloane a very famous and powerful california defense attorney they talk o'hara into working for them despite his initial reservations it seems to him and to the audience that elsa is just looking for someone to have an affair with and o'hara doesn't want to get involved shortly after going to work on their yacht a strange man george grisby glenn anders who says he's arthur's partner shows up at a port of call and begins stirring up trouble eventually grisby asks o'hara to enter into a very dubious and dangerous scheme foolishly o'hara agrees naturally it gets him into quite a bit of trouble and eventually a number of mysteries are revealed maybe my problems with the film lie in the fact that so far i'm not exactly a huge fan of orson welles and here he produces writes directs and consumes most of the screen time i haven't seen anywhere near the majority of welles' work yet but i've tended to like his later films better when he became a bit more campy and performance arty i love f for fake vérités et mensonges 1974 for example and i even kind of like his performance in casino royale 1967 when he bizarrely insisted on being allowed to do magic tricks at a baccarat table but citizen kane 1941 never did much for me despite giving it 3 or 4 chances over the years including about one year ago my rating was a low 7 the same as my current score for the lady from shanghai welles' performance and the dialogue he's written for himself come across as affected and pretentious to me he's a bit of a motormouth a bit of a boor and a bit monotone he tends to sound like he's reading his performance reminded me of what i've seen of welles' version of moby dick listed on imdb as 1999 but completed in 1971 it can also be seen in orson welles the one man band 1995 where he seems to be just reading to the camera and believing that he's inherently sublimely dramatic i'm also someone who almost never complains about accents but somehow welles manages to make his irish accent sound affected and pretentious to me too as for the other performances i can only say i thought hayworth did an excellent job of course she's gorgeous which doesn't hurt plenty of eye candy here like welles sloane also seemed a bit affected and pretentious to me i never quite bought his character his handicap and so on and anders is simply bizarre where bizarre doesn't seem to fit welles often shoots him in close up and anders almost always has some over exaggerated manic expression on his sweaty face structurally the lady from shanghai is very uneven the first 50 minutes or so are extremely bland and soap operatic although the soap opera ministrations tend to be approached from a tortuous oblique once grisby introduces his scheme things pick up a bit and mostly improve as we near the end but by the time the lady from shanghai becomes a crime mystery film it's too little too late and it quickly turns into a courtroom drama before the sudden thrilling ending that comes almost out of nowhere and is over far too quickly for its relative excellence the ending is more action oriented less dialogue heavy more varied and exotic in settings and at times fairly abstract welles handles that combination of material skillfully as a director if the lady from shanghai would have been a largely a combination of the crime mystery stuff and the arty ending it could have easily been at least a 9 the final scenes are easily 10s as welles shifts from a hitchcockian suspense scene in a san francisco chinese opera house to another suspense scene in a chinese amusement park the funhouse climax uses cinematography that was experimental for its time it's well integrated with the script as it allows a complex resolution and fuels a lot of symbolism the cinematography throughout is interesting even if it usually can't make up for the problems in the foreground welles blocks scenes with skill there are lots of attractively filmed settings from central park to acapulco to various san francisco locations welles effectively creates symbolic backdrops for his action from the emphasized heights and precipitous drops of acapulco to the maze like caribbean streets the beautifully framed and silhouetted shots of the san francisco aquarium and so on the romance material for which the aquarium serves as one backdrop is interestingly tempered with a kind of unease throughout the film but on the other hand that makes the romance never quite work as romance surely serious welles fans will appreciate the lady from shanghai much more than i did and of course it's worth a watch if you love rita hayworth the lady from shanghai isn't exactly a terrible film in my view but it's dangerously close to not passing proceed with caution	positive
yesterday my spanish catalan wife and myself saw this emotional lesson in history spain is going into the direction of political confrontation again that is why this masterpiece should be shown in all spanish high schools it is a tremendous lesson in the hidden criminality of fascism the american pilot who gets involved in the spanish civil war chooses for the democratically elected republican government the criminal role of religion is surprisingly well shown in one of the most inventive scenes that uribe ever made the colors are magnificent the cruelty of a war could anybody tell me the difference between any war and a civil war is used as a scenario of hope when two young children express their feelings and protect each other the cowards that start their abuse of power even towards innocent children are now active again a film like 'el viaje de carol' 'carol's journey' tells one of the so many sad stories of the 20th century it is a better lesson in history than any book could contain again great work from the peninsula iberica	positive
jane austen's emma is an extremely enjoyable story at the worst of times and this production of the story is the best i have ever seen kake beckinsale's emma is irreproachable gwyneth paltrow with the help of a good screenplay and excellent cinematography is able to bring out the comedy effectively she fails to make emma likeable paltrow is not aided by the fact that her hairstyles are simply 'wrong' for the part and i believe the era and she looks positively ill in the empire line dresses kate beckinsale on the other hand manages the comedy effortlessly and is still able to show what mr knightly the most romantic of jane austen's heroes actually sees in her mark strong is a splendid mr knightly with the right mix of handsome looks an appropriate age chivalry compassion and gentlemanly behaviour emma and mr knightly are supported by a cast of good actors and the production as a whole is quite delightful	positive
how truly friendly charming and cordial is this unpretentious old serial i rejoiced in seeing old lugosi it is disarmingly friendly and lively it's the document of a long lost craft the best tv series today can hardly compete with these old moderately good serials chandu is deeply deeply optimistic and hedonistic it refreshes the mind it's not stupid stupid are those who do not get the terms on which such serials work chandu has an irresistible sense of simple unpretentious and friendly fun without giving away too much chandu is an occidental sorcerer who goes also by this eastern name and who also loves and protects his niece against a sect of killers chandu exerts his supernatural gifts in a rather discreet and moderate way as to the quite sexy niece nadji she is kidnapped by the priest of ubasti the sordid vindhyan the poor sexy girl is in fact multiply kidnapped in a sarcophagus after being sent asleep with a flower almost kidnapped from a boat by a phony policeman the temple of lemuria and its strange creepy ceremonies resemble the king kong imagery and are a barbaric mockery of the rcc ceremonies and rituals would you protect a girl as bravely as chandu does lugosi looked like an old libidinous and quite heartless mean drunk and this only contributed to his performances he is the prototypical mean drunk uncle mischievous and cunning and oblique this might sound like a rather crooked homage to lugosi yet burton's biopic of wood left me this impression about lugosi and allied to it a strong sympathy for the decrepit actor i enjoy lugosi' fancy performances this serial is unjustly bashed	positive
one of cary grant's most enduring comedies is mr blandings builds his dream house although judging by the size of it the dwelling would be a dream mansion today still cary was making a good living in the advertising field even though he was having a devil of a time trying to come up with a slogan for ham with the brand name of wham what made this film so popular was the housing shortage of the post world war ii years returning veterans from the war were claiming their entitlements under the gi bill of rights which included home loans the problem was there literally were not enough houses to satisfy the demand around the time the book by eric hodgins and the film were so popular congress passed and president truman signed the taft ellender wagner housing law which put the government for the first time in the home building business i had an uncle and aunt who were around the same time building their own home which they moved into in the early fifties like cary grant and myrna loy they had two daughters and were looking to get out of inner city rochester their place wasn't quite as grand as a house in connecticut with eighteen rooms still they lived there the rest of their lives the way cary and myrna most likely did of course it was expensive and the costs just keep adding up and up threatening to send cary to the cleaners cary and myrna also have melvyn douglas around to offer counsel usually too late truth be told he's kind of sweet on myrna and cary knows it myrna loy's role is simply an extension of nora charles if you can imagine the charles's moving to the country and william powell having the headaches cary grant does the film would still work just fine mr blandings builds his dream house still works well as comedy because the situations are universal and this review is dedicated to my uncle walter and aunt kate who lived in their dream house together for over 40 years	positive
wow pretty amazing that something this bad could actually be made i am giving this movie a 2 because it is so bad it has a certain car wreck kind of appeal its so bad its comical and that does have a certain entertainment value plus there is a bit of gratuitous nudity and that is always appreciated so where do i begin the acting is beyond awful its like you are watching a high school play being filmed theresa russell must have done something really bad to have been forced to make this movie and her acting reflects how happy she is to be in the middle of this mess the rest of the cast is simply silly with the casting of dan cortese as an fbi agent the cherry on the top of this piece of crap his acting actually had me laughing at loud as for the screenplay and the directing c courtney joyner and mark l lester should simply be taken out back and shot	negative
the silly saying you can't touch this surely applies here with all the clone horror and sci fi films coming out along with all the inferior remakes it's hard to find anything worthy of 2 hours of your time that's why i always rely on the classics that scared the weewee out of me when i was a pre teen the thing is without an ounce of doubt in my mind the goriest ickiest screechiest sci fi horror classic that john carpenter or any other director sorry even you mr spielberg ever made what really gives it power though is not the gore it ooooozes of slime and blood and god knows what other fluids but rather the sense of dread isolation and distrust it fosters in the characters and the viewer you can't get more remote than antarctica and in this howling freezing white setting is where the story takes place several americans researchers and military men are stationed there one day they witness a siberian husky dog running for dear life from gun wielding norwegians before they know it the american outpost is battling a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants it may morph into disgusting slimy bloody shapes before it's finished but once it's finished if you didn't see it in progress you can't tell it among humans or other normal earth animals kurt russell keith david wilford brimley richard masur donald moffatt tk carter thomas waites and charles hallahan are just a few of the fine cast this film is the reason why horror can be a great genre it actually still scares me the alien blood jumping out of the petri dish when the hot wire touches it still makes me jump still the scariest of them all	positive
i can get very tired of murder mysteries with the exception of a few really excellent tv series otherwise there are just too many of these murder plot themes i don't like the theme of the two over clever selfish youths killing as an intellectual exercise i've no interest whatsoever in hitchcock who appears to have been associated with this in some way i don't intend to find out about but don't misunderstand me the theme is in itself excellent the whole movie is so well done and of course sandra bullock is superlative as always sandra's character is as in miss congeniality not rated by the male team she works with in spite of her obvious skills and the boss mostly ignores her ideas eventually forcing her aside and giving the case to her male partner of course sandra works out what's going on and nearly gets killed in a very dramatic denouement it's intriguing how the boy who worked out the murder plot can't allow her to be killed by his colleague he has a conscience of some sort and perhaps could be saved while the other is a true psychopath sandra's hard shell is caused by misery in her past that's tied in poignantly with the murder case her colleague realising that sandra's solving this case in spite of being balked by the dense superior finally discovers what happened to sandra herself in her teens that she must now face up to and exorcise and the last scene shows her starting we hope anyway to do just that i can see from the few other reviews i've had time to read that this movie would attract a broadish group those interested in the two spoilt boys whiling away their time with their grisly philosophical determination to trick the police and get away with the perfect murder the relationship between them that's so cleverly depicted the ghastly links to the heroine's past a police theme and some smokes and mirrors as well as for hitchcock fans for those who've queried why bullock's character has to have a problematic past really i think this would be a far less interesting movie if she had been just a detective trying to fathom what was going on with a willing sidekick helping out and a male chauvinist boss the link between the murder victim and the detective is necessary to show the detective becoming too involved or otherwise how would she lose her arrogant boss's confidence and thereby nearly lose her life that's hardly an original theme in fact it's usually an extremely irritating theme as this male chauvinist boss brutally tells his frustrated but obviously inspired operative to get off the case and leave it to someone who clearly doesn't have quite the skills to solve it nice though the sidekick is i was getting very worried towards the end re what might happen to sandra's character as her emotional involvement in the case and special sympathy for the unfortunate victim of the crime dangerously drove her on with this case by herself i wasn't disappointed re the relationship between bullock's character and her sidekick that goes along interestingly and at times very poignantly the relationship between the two boys is definitely intriguing if that's what you were interested in watching i felt it was kept low key in some ways either because the movie makers didn't want to get into boy boy friendships too much or because we weren't supposed to think emotion ruled their relationship the movie cleverly makes you wonder which boy's in charge of the situation and there are some twists and turns and the boys show their underlying immaturity at various stages there one thing i wish had been clarified and that's what happens after the movie ends when sandra's character arrives at the court you need to see to movie to know why she's there very well acted by all i certainly can't agree with those who complained against bullock's acting she was superb the part suited her very well indeed the story is gripping even if murder mysteries aren't your thing and they aren't that often mine	positive

e elias merhige's begotten is a one of a kind surreal depiction of the mankind's treatment of religion there are a couple of different ways you can interpret things but the plot itself is simple a god disembowels himself and out of his corpse springs mother earth mother earth then felates the god's corpse post mortem and then impregnates herself with what remains of his seed following this she gives birth to a messiah figure who quivers presumably in infancy but possibly with terror at being brought to life on earth this all takes place in the first 15 30 minutes and after that the rest of the film consists of robed figures dragging the messiah who is incessantly quivering or seizing across a desert landscape the robed figures pause only to brutalize the messiah then continue to drag him around there are a couple of ways to interpret this depending on your level of optimism and your world view it can easily be interpreted as a bleak nihilistic atheist allegory about the total lack of apparent power that christian deities can be perceived as having in a modern society that only invokes their names to advance its own selfish goals or you can interpret it as a postmodern pro christian allegory in which you view the film as being about how mankind has twisted christ's message around so much that it's original purity and innocence can no longer have relevance in a world where that message and image are inappropriately used to endorse everything from interpersonal violence to war to totalitarianism the visuals of this film are phenomenal and you will not see anything like it period if you can watch the original vhs release i recommend it i'm not sure if the visuals are changed on the dvd but i have seen clips of this streaming on you tube and the effects are seriously diminished on the vhs version merhige achieved total binary contrast meaning there basically aren't any mid tones except for some grain in some of the shots other than that this film offers the rare opportunity to see pure white and pure black and the result is stunning hallucinatory and quite unsettling this film makes film noir look positively washed out and mediocre the shots fade into each other in a surreal manner that recalls un chien andalou without completely aping it for an effect that has been called a filmic rorschach test that being said the film can certainly try a viewer's patience and commitment there isn't any dialogue for starters the only sound throughout the film is a fairly constant loop of crickets chirping peppered occasionally with the gurgling and death rattles of the dying deities and an amelodic droning synthesizer texture personally i find that the film is best enjoyed listening to experimental industrial music like the instrumental nin remixes from the downward spiral era more abstract noise experimental music like f ck buttons and odd nosdam it also works quite well with apocalyptic black metal basically any music with extreme textures and or hypnotic rhythms that's one of the most amazing and versatile aspects of this film it is prime for postmodern re contextualization like projecting it during a performance of avant garde music or composing avant garde music to accompany it once the messiah figure is born there really isn't much change for the rest of the film meaning that you are basically sitting through at least 45 minutes or more of the messiah figure being drug around the desert and beaten it looks bleakly beautiful but there isn't really anything new unfolding it helps to cement the filmmakers intentions of communicating that for thousands of years now people have been using christ's name and image for personal benefits but can be tiresome to a casual viewer or someone with a short attention span basically if you are looking for a modern horror film with suspense look elsewhere if you are looking for a unique film experience and you aren't particularly fond of mainstream hollywood cinema this could be your quivering messiah	positive
while others may contend that by viewing other works by bilal one will better appreciate this movie it does fail in one major way it does not stand on its own the plot is a mishmash that is confuses symbolism with substance here's an idea start with a definite story then craft symbolism around it we start with two different narratives this female that is somehow turning human a god that is for some reason being judged but getting one last fling on earth and this mysterious john character who seems to be developing some sort of resort just beyond the bounds of the city why none of these questions are answered but do we care no there is no development to want us to empathize with any character in the story the closest we get jill and even then the development is spotty at best unfortunately the movie gets caught up in the the whole visually impressive which it is but at the expense of motivic development i would love to see this rewritten by someone who could distance themselves from the material a bit and not have to feel that every image has to be in the picture	negative
i never comment on a film but i have to say that this was one of the worst films that i have ever seen i feel it was made by a beginner film student and not to put down talented film students but this was horrible i did not buy the lead actress and felt i was in acting class with her while she was on film her decisions were very safe and i feel she was mimicking other actresses in films and not acting and making her own decisions the direction was very confusing and the sound was louder than the actors themselves the end may have made a little more sense if there was someone narrating the events and not a song i love patsy cline but she her songs appear quite frequently in films maybe the song selection could have been a little more original the song crazy was such a cliché as i said before i never comment on films and have seen my share of good and bad but this was the worst sorry	negative
there's no denying the first azumi film was a commercial product it was an adaptation of a popular manga and had cast of young attractive actors and certainly wasn't lacking in the budget department yet it more than entertained for what it was and i can't deny i enjoyed it immensely azumi 2 lacks just about everything that made the original so wonderful the first thing that should set alarm bells ringing is the absence of the superb ryuhei kitamura at the helm with him he seemed to take not only his own visual flair and kinetics but the originals style beauty and most importantly its heart while the first had a simple hitlist plot this one has a corkscrew mess of a story with too many dull characters stabbing each other in the back so many times the potential for any sympathy or pathos is obliterated gone is the effective interplay between the lead characters azumi and her cohorts are often reduced to a bunch of stroppy teenagers arguing in a forest characterisation is non existent if anyone watching actually cares who lives and who dies i'll be shocked the same applies to the villains here the final battle in fact all the battles are completely devoid of any sort of tension the fact that they are poorly choreographed and abysmally directed not to mention few and far between is made a sideline by their own sheer pointlessness the villains themselves try far too hard to be campy and even if they were all combined they don't come within a country mile of the pete burnsian antics of jo odagiri in the original major spoiler at end of paragraph aya ueto tries her best it has to be said and she also managed to keep her hair in good condition between the films azumi is now a fully fledged assassin meaning she can wave her sword around in slow motion unfortunately now the character is instilled with a sort of man with no name style mysteriousness ueto's model looks become even more inappropriate i know this is supposed to be the point but this combined with the ineffectiveness of everyone else in the film the stupidity of the plot and the general ineptness of the film in general means it is downright impossible to get behind her character this time around the less said about chiaki remember me from kill bill kuriyama's performance the better it suffices to say her turn from good to evil is about as subtle as napalm overall this was just a colossal disappointment any merits is does have were done ten times better in the first film a lazy unsatisfying and generally downright boring mess	negative
as previously stated in one of my great reviews the universal pictures'trilogy of flash gordon should not be classified with the other serials for indeed the three of these have made a sort of celluloid electronic mythology for a punchy war phobic mid twentieth century world they stand alone in many peoples' minds as the example of just what a cliff hanger was we can recall seeing buster crabbhe as a guest on nbc's late night talk show tomorrow hosted by tom snyder this was circa 1979 80 during the interview mr crabbe was asked about his personal fitness habits he credited weight training and swimming coupled with some sound dietary habits which included vitamin and protein supplementation and would you believe it he smoked several cigarettes when questioned about his career mr snyder of course got to the subject of his portrayal and strong identification with the character of flash buster stated that he had read and enjoyed the feature in its original medium that is a comic strip the property of hearst's king features syndicate he stated that he had thought that it would not work once transferred to the screen luckily he was wrong as for the 1st serial it was a very good adaption of the original continuity from the sunday color comics the world is about to end because of impending collision with planet mongo it's up to independent working dr zarkov to rocket to the wild planet to change its course he enlists the aid of flash and miss dale arden newly acquainted parachuters from airliner landing in zarkov's property the serial has excitement through out and manages to make one feel that there is always some other peril lurking just outside the film frame the costuming and decor is varied from romanesque to oriental to art decco it would be easy to surmise that this was due to frugality on the part of universal but once again this was being faithful to creator cartoonist alex raymond's visual concepts just look at the old strips as reprinted in many collections the rockets were used before in just imagine fox 1930 a science fiction musical comedy the other scientific lab equipment was provided by universal's prop dept being the top hollywood company doing horror and scifi the cast features jean rogers dale arden and priscilla lawson princess aura who get into a good girl vs bad girl battle over flash charles middleton portrays emperor ming in a sort of overly melodramatic villain but makes it work zarkov frank shannon is toned down from the sheer madness that he suffered in his appearance in newsprint by the way ever wonder how zar kov has a brogue richard alexander makes a fine powerfully built prince barin ever helpful and so noble comic actor jack tiny lipson is the surprise of the cast stealing scene after scene as a lecherous henry viii like scoundrel turned ally king vultan ruler of the hawkmen among the others most notable is jim pierce as prince thun of the lion men pierce like crabbe had also portrayed tarzan in a film but he later married tarzan creator edgar rice bourroughs' daughter joan flash gordon and the two sequels flash gordon's trip to mars 1938 and flash gordon conquers the universe 1940 have been a staple juvenile fare for generations first in the movie houses then in television release like fine wine they seen to get better with age we're all so glad that mr crabbe was wrong	positive
yes even as a fan of shows like survivor and the apprentice this show is pretty bad i didn't mind the first couple of shows but then realizing how pathetic everyone was to actually go on the show in the first place the antics of alex and aaron giving men a bad name at the way they cheated on or dumped their choice at the first opportunity really was not a good look for the show ryan you can have trista she had the most annoying voice i've ever heard on television and she definitely wasn't the smartest girl around very media savvy but i doubt there's much more there i haven't really watched any of the shows since apart from the occastional re run on daytime tv i think the point of reality tv is to treat it as entertaining trash view it as something you can laugh over and don't have to think too hard about i don't watch csi its like reality tv tired and clichéd but you have to think too much anyway while watching a couple of thoughts on some reasons fro going on the show at the very first 'the woman tell all woman such as amy who had a lot of class about her commented that she had tried every scene aka the bar and club scene to meet a guy and it wasn't happening for her hey amy how about joining a club getting a hobby doing charity work changing your job to one where you meet more guys gees all i know is that going to a bar is not the ideal place to meet a future partner amy and many of the other girls seemed to be obsessed with the idea of meeting the perfect man' clue to ladies he doesn't exist there are however many great guys out there that would make great husbands some who may be right for you they may not earn six figures a year or be a jfk junior look alike but they are great guys all the same the shallowness of woman on this show is quite unbelievable im still a youngster at was lead to believe that woman gradually grew out of their shallowness as they got older and more realistic about their future partner this show is proving otherwise overall this show does a lot to confirm many stereotypes of how woman view men in society it really is a terrible show and i think all of these types of shows should just stop being made the best dating shows by a country mile are blind date and the fifth wheel because they are fun nothing is manned more between the couples than a simple night out the bachelor sadly takes itself way too seriously	negative
the weakness of this comes from the confusing storytelling plots often coming out of nowhere but it really didn't matter because i still enjoyed it to it's full length once you actually accept that this movies not to be taken too seriously then you'll enjoy it even more it's basically a love story a confusing one at first but as it evolves it really is something worthwhile sure it's been done so many times before but the complicated version of this is quite inspiring and touching the over the top fantasy and cgi was overwhelming at first but i still enjoyed its purpose and people quit whining about how it borrowed from other movies guess what we know and it doesn't really matter because its purpose was to humour and entertain sometimes people has to stop being so critical and think for a moment before they start yapping about comparing this to hollywood standards is utterly stupid and ignorant it's a totally different style and target audience as far as i'm concerned some the best films i've feasted my eyes upon are from eastern producers and directors there's your police story 4 shaolin soccer kung fu hustle dragon tiger gate fist of legend hero crouching tiger etc i for one like this movie and haling from the philippines us england libya and now australia i'll always be interested in these types of films now try and judge my perception but i warn you i do see things from from the point of view of those 5 countries i've lived in so you better be as experienced and open minded	positive
this might have a spoiler when i first started watching this movie i thought it was ok the music was good and that bizarro dream sequence i was willing to forgive but the lack of looks in the main character and all of the other characters for that matter made me uninterested in watching the rest of this film i know totally vain the music at the beginning was spirited and fitting i thought for a mock gothic novel but come on saxophone music for an early 19th century film it totally didn't fit this movie was totally boring and if you're looking to watch a good period film or an austen don't rent northanger abbey i give it a 30 30 a failing grade	negative
from 1996 first i watched this movie i feel never reach the end of my satisfaction i feel that i want to watch more and more until now my god i don't believe it was ten years ago and i can believe that i almost remember every word of the dialogues i love this movie and i love this novel absolutely perfection i love willem defoe he has a strange voice to spell the words black night and i always say it for many times never being bored i love the music of szararem it's so much spiritualistic made me come into another world deep in my heart anyone can feel what i feel and anyone could make the movie like this i don't believe so thanks ondaatje thanks mingela	positive
six months after high school sprinter laura dies during a race a killer begins to murder the rest of the track team using a variety of sports equipment as weapons that's the daft plot of early 80s slasher graduation day a lacklustre addition to the genre that offers very little in the way of style originality or decent gore what it does deliver however are some stunningly awful musical interludes a few familiar faces including an early appearance from scream queen linnea quigley and a smattering of nudity a prerequisite of any slasher movie so forget the death scenes they're lame and rather bloodless and instead enjoy the movie's more memorably crap elements the rapid editing that can induce migraines and epileptic seizures the roller disco which is accompanied by a prolonged heavy rock song ' gangster rock' as performed by the unforgettably awful felony an impromptu jamming session by the school's students christopher george hamming it up as chief red herring coach michaels and the cheesy music teacher who letches after his female students who for some reason find him quite irresistible towards the end of the film the action picks up a little with the discovery of the slaughtered kids' bodies under the bleachers and a quite twisted scene featuring laura's corpse in her cap and gown but it all comes way to late in the day to save this film from mediocrity	negative
scary movie 2 is definitely the worst of the 4 films for there is not much of a plot bad acting pretty tedious and some really cheesy jokes but and this is a big but there is one good actor one good recurring joke and a good beginning the good actor being tim curry the one good recurring joke is the creepy weird butler with the disgusting hand who always does cringey but laugh worthy things and the good beginning is the spoof of the excorsist the plot to scary movie 2 is the main characters from the original and a host of new characters along the way are invited to stay the night at a creepy old mansion but will they survive the night this film is not very good but if your bored you might as well watch it	negative
if you haven't seen this movie than you need to it rocks and you have to watch it it is so funny and will make you laugh your guts out so you have to watch it and i saw it about a billion and a half times and still think it is funny so you have to yes i have memorized the whole movie and could quote it to you from start to finish you must see this move it is also cute because it is half a chick flick if you don't watch it then you are really missing out this movie even has cute guys in it and that is always a bonus so in summary watch the movie now and trust me you will not be making a mistake did i mention the music is good too so you should like it if you enjoy music this is a movie that they rated correctly and it will work for anyone	positive
golden boy is ecchi humor bordering on hentai in the guise of educational moments the main character kintaro wanders around getting himself into the silliest situations involving women it's just that he's shy on the surface but analyses everything until he can learn something from it the most striking feature of the series are the circumstances surrounding his education which are outright embarrassing yet funny at the same time	positive
to be clear from the get go 'the bagman' is very very very bad it suffers terribly in almost every aspect except for one the finished product is such an awful film that it's actually hysterically funny to watch this is a very low grade film budget constraints for the film should be obvious to anyone who watches even just the opening title sequence i'm not sure if much of the humour in the film was intended or not for example the movie takes place in 'doomsville ' note to all prospective home buyers if the town you're moving to is called 'doomsville ' keep moving stephanie beaton is quick to pull off her top for a pretty enthusiastic sex scene in the kitchen i couldn't help but laugh because it has intentional humour she turns on the gas stove get it the sex is that hot get it and unintentional humour the unintentional in this case is the music it's like the theme music for 'chariots of fire' goes electronica break out the computer and the synthesizers i realize that coming up with music for a small production like this is cost prohibitive i really feel for them because the work here is so well intentioned the problem is that cheap music isn't necessarily good music i haven't laughed so hard at sex on screen since 'alone in the dark' with that 'seven seconds' song i guess they were implying that poor old mr slater was a bit quick on the draw even the end credits are hilarious intentional or not you be the judge a pet dog and cat are part of the credited cast and an animal wrangler was on set for them the boom is credited to 'mr b stick ' and the 3rd unit's wardrobe yep they had a third unit is credited to k mart maybe it's just me but i think the hilarity of this more than saves the film the movie is very very bad but the goals of stephanie beaton her friends and family are so well intentioned in 'the bagman' that you can't help but like the movie they've produced 'the bagman' is bad but not dreadful in its own sweet way it even manages to be a bit endearing it wears its flaws so honestly that you can't help but forgive them better films that try to hide the flaws are almost worse in a way i guess this is just a film that knew who its audience was and was produced accordingly watch any number of movies and most of them will probably be a lot better than this some of them might look cheaper or have worse acting or sillier production value they may not suffer terribly as 'the bagman' does from awful editing sound and foley effects mr b stick didn't do a very good job the special effects look to be where most of the money went they tend to be more funny than gruesome although when the 'bagman' is finally unmasked at the end the make up job there is surprisingly well done my 4 out of 10 is a little high but the humour helped a lot this is an ideal movie to track down some night with a few friends and a few beers in hand great entertainment is to be had by anyone who seriously considers themselves b movie or low budget film aficionados all others should probably avoid with great prejudice	negative

a group of tourists are stranded on snake island after an unfortunate accident with their boat they are forced to spend the night and as you probably suspected it isn't called snake island because it's just soooooo much fun to say it has a history of people disappearing one by one because of the large snake population which is just what happens with these poor dumb souls this is a very boring and typical movie with tons of off screen snake attacks and lousy performances from nobody actors the only somewhat entertaining scene was an absolutely unnecessary and forced strip scene which ain't anything couldn't see in a pg13 rated movie folks if you are into snake movies than check out sssssss but don't torture yourself with this crap	negative
the sad thing about frontline is that once you watch three or four episodes of it you really begin to understand that it is not far away from what happens in real life what is really sad is that it also makes extremely funny the frontline team in series one consists of brian thompson bruno lawrence a man who truly lives and dies merely by the ratings his show gets occasionally his stunts to achieve these ratings see him run in with his line producer emma thompson alison whyte a woman who hasn't lost all her journalistic integrity and is prepared to defend moral scruples on occasions the same cannot be said of reporter brooke vandenberg jane kennedy a reporter who has had all the substance sucked out of her so much so that when interviewing ben elton she needs to be instructed to laugh her reports usually consist of interviewing celebrities with whom she has or hasn't 'crossed paths' with before or scandalous unethical reports that usually backfire martin de stasio tiriel mora is the reporter with whom the team relies on for gravitas and dignity as he has the smarts of 21 years of journalism behind him his doesn't have principles so much as a nous of what makes a good journalistic story though he does draw the occasional line parading over this chaos in name is mike moore rob sitch an egotistical naive reporter who can't see that he's only a pretty face for the grubby journalism he often finds his morals being compromised simply because brian appeals to his vanity and allows his stupidity to do the rest frontline is the sort of show that there needs to be more of because it shows that while in modern times happiness safety and deep political insight are interesting things it's much easier to rate with scandal fear and tabloid celebrities	positive
i rented zero day from the local video store last week i had never heard of the film and i had my reservations about it just from looking at the box i knew the film was an indie film and therefore the quality was going to be less than a mainstream film i can tell you that after i finished watching zero day i immediately started it from the beginning again the film was clearly following the basic outline of what happened at columbine high school of april of 1999 but what struck me was how believable the two lead actors were my first time through watching this film i wasn't entirely sure if what i was watching were actual tapes left behind by the shooters at columbine in the back of my mind i knew what i was watching could not be real but at the same time the acting was so convincing you had to keep giving your head a shake is the film disturbing absolutely are you going to see things that will make you question the merit of the film probably i think what most people will find disturbing is they will actually have feelings for the two lead characters calvin and andre played by cal robertson and andre keuck why is that problematic for some people calvin and andre are planning a massacre at their high school i know for myself i felt an immense sadness for andre and calvin i had empathy for them because their lives had come to such a horrific point they had fallen so deeply through cracks that they had begun a journey down a road which could have been stopped if only people around them had taken notice to their plight zero day is a phenomenal film it gives you an up close and personal look to events that most of us will only ever see the conclusion to on the news it leaves you thinking about the lives involved and it leaves you perplexed how people get to this point a week after seeing this film i still think about it those of you who have not seen zero day please keep in mind the following the film is an independent with little to no budget and the film is shot on camcorders the material in the film is disturbing this is not mainstream hollywood and there is no happy ending but if you can put all that aside zero day is a film that will stick with you and just maybe help you to open your eyes a little	positive
after many many years i saw again this beautiful love story thinking about how would i half a century after react to a film which made so many girls cry and sigh at that time when i was just an male adolescent trying to understand women's behaviors in a small city in brazil this time however what caught my attention in the film was something very different namely the insistence with which the physician dr han suyin jennifer jones makes clear to the journalist mark elliott william holden her special ethically condition as an eurasian in fact she is constantly putting emphasis on this point in their relationship repeating she is willing to assume her love for him and carry it on in a occidental way provided that by doing so she is not betraying her chinese side its seems to the spectator that suyin is eagerly making efforts to establish a very subtle conciliation between those two unstable and opposite aspects of her culture for they will immediately engage in overt conflict in her mind at a minimum failure in her attempts to control them therefore suyin's attitudes always leave poor elliott a determined brave and extremely practical man anxious and perplexed without knowing how much importance to give to her words for him whose love for her is plain and simple the situation is totally clear if we love each other let us make a couple and begin immediately a life together not so fast is what she seems verbally and non verbally to answer him all the time in fact suyin's chinese portion would never allow her such a level of pragmatism and as she goes on and on reinforcing this much aimed equilibrium between those two worlds inside herself she also frequently signals to him that also a very peculiar trait of chinese culture is deeply rooted in her mind namely the constant raids on the real world by invisible beings from an spiritual or non physical world for suyin is always alerting elliott about how dangerous is life not because of any objective and concrete threat as would be the perpetuation of the english colonialism or the eminence of a japanese invasion but due to the threats of plenty of cruel and harmful gods and other mystical and mythical beings over the poor fearful and vulnerable human beings in fact it looks like a whole bunch of chinese deities are permanently on the watch to make people's life totally miserable because of that mothers must dress their precious male babies in girls clothes so that they are not taken away by jealous gods everyone should always be ready to make loud noises to send the clouds away in order to avoid their covering the sight of the moon peasants are advised that they should shout loudly the rice is bad the rice is bad to protect their crops from being stolen by deities and in a funeral it is recommended that the dead's family be isolated from the other people by curtains so that the gods don't take advantage of their sorrow and fragility in other words suyin introduces us to a culture in which the supernatural has a real existence as if a rather disturbing pantheon of malign and sadistic gods are always on the verge of negatively interfering with the most banal acts in anyone's daily life as the story takes place in hong kong in 1949 it should be clear that china really was at that time almost a semi feudal society while the country from which elliott had come from was not yet dominated by the fierce capitalism that launched by the usa after the first oil shock in 1973 took charge of the whole world therefore at least in one aspect both sides of suyin's eurasian personality were still much more innocent than they would be today a lot of history came into being since those old days as to china the main fact is that after several phases of a communist regime the country finally reached in the last two decades the condition of a very aggressive economy much more properly described as state capitalism and what happened to that old spirituality that so much enthralled suyin in hong kong in 1949 and with which she used to impress so much an impassioned elliott under that tree on the hill behind the hospital it is gone completely gone in brief if that story took place today elliott would not find it necessary to go to china to propose to suyin in the presence of the third uncle and her entire family in fact both men would now be incomparably closer to one another in their huge pragmatism talking business as usual	positive
all the right elements seemed to conspire here to make this a memorable thriller for years to come you have the stellar cast michael douglas in an uncharacteristic 'free spirit' role that pretty much launched his movie career fonda playing her typical forthright female doing her bit for womens lib and jack lemmon as assured as ever showing us a man with a crisis of confidence give them a hot button topic about big business being duplicitous and that's encouraging for a kickoff but to have life imitating art so soon after is a marketing man's dream the script is impressively taut intelligent but mercifully keeping the jargon to a minimum and there is a genuine sense of sustained tension brought in play by the director as our three protagonists race to beat the clock if you like 'whistle blowing' dramas then this is not quite as good as the insider but the whole thing is more than nervy enough	positive
i think i agree that a lot of the comments here must be fake even if the movie is not necessarily bad its definitely below average dark remains is basically a ghost movie with a premise of your own ghosts and bad emotions haunting you the movie starts off already with 2 stories loosely inter webbed which even later are not tied together a couple loses its child which is found slashed in its bed they move to a country house to flee their past and guess what the house is haunted kind of from here on dark remains starts off very slow with some scary moments indeed the first ghost appearances are nice and the flashlight sequence also worked very good ok then woman sees ghost of daughter other ghosts of people died in accidents or suicides appear man tries to solve secret of houses past woman gets depressed strange neighbors appear its pretty much all been there but the premise of it being their own emotions is nice so you wait for the twist there is no twist you are just confused by a haunted house history story the strange neighbor a totally pointless creepy prison and the dead daughter thrown together with a photo idea reminding me a lot of the shutter the end is ridiculous because when you start and end a movie this slow and with piano music its pretty lame to include some hoards of ghosts at once which look like a zombie flick of course just to return to slow pacing and piano music to make it short dark remains could have been a nice scary ghost story if the script was not trying to go everywhere and arriving nowhere too many stories mushed together which just don't make any sense and contradict in the basic atmosphere of the movie and beside please never use abandoned prisons again its so worn off and in this case it even makes no sense at all hey there is this creepy prison uphill lets shoot there i guess a lot of ingredients in dark remains were thrown in the mix like this	negative
this movie seemed like it was going to be better than it ended up being the cinematography is good the acting seemed solid the dialogue wasn't too stiff but then about twenty minutes in there's this long scene with a doctor who you know is actually a patient at the asylum pretending to be a doctor and it just goes south from there on top of that the demon is about the silliest looking hellspawn since the godzilla looking thing in curse of the demon there's also some odd demon worshippers who wear masks that look like the exploding teens from the beginning of logan's run in the end the cinematography couldn't save this movie despite some pretty solid performances by the actors the story just doesn't go anywhere i think hellbored would have been a better title for this	negative
even though this was a made for tv production there's absolutely no excuse for the rock bottom results of the finished product this movie did have a budget and it had a casting department so if you're going to make a movie about a true life story and actually put the true story in the title shouldn't some effort be put forward to try and capture some realism first of all this movie is absurdly cast these actors belong in daytime television soaps or in those ridiculous lifetime channel movies and not in a real life gangster criminal tale everything about them from their looks to their mannerisms just screams of the 90's shopping mall alt rock listening generation what about the script two words describes it stupid and insulting and again it's way too 90ish sounding i don't think the real clyde barrow ever uttered the words i'm outta here it's as if a bunch of new kids on the block fans got together and decided to make a really kewl flick about bonnie and clyde you know one that would be totally rad and rockin' well this sticker doesn't even rank on the rad and rockin' scale everything that can be wrong with any kind of film is wrong here from the casting and acting to the editing and music every single thing is grossly wrong and it's infuriating that the parties responsible for this atrocious turkey had the nerve to put the true story in the title it's certainly not the true story but even worse it's not even remotely entertaining as a mindless popcorn flick that's accepted on its own terms like i stated in my heading it's simply horrible beyond words on every level imaginable trust me on this or watch at your own risk	negative
fantastic film wow this is really a treat i can't believe that i discovered such a gem of a movie a pretty young girl traveling south to florida meets a friendly older couple with an rv after she has a flat at a rest stop however she learns that things aren't as they seem and the couple gets a bit creepy after she spends some time on the road with them everyone in it was just so perfect for their parts you just about believe that you are watching this happen in real life in front of you newcomer emily grace did a fantastic job as the really cute yet somewhat shy alice emily gives you the feeling that you can understand what she is experiencing and you can see just how she got into the situation that develops in the film i'm sure we'll be seeing emily in more films in the future contrary to what some others have said the lighting and photography in this were just perfect the editing was done well too just the right way to put together images of the highway to give you the feeling that you are traveling along with the cast on their road trip i didn't see it on the big screen but i can only urge everyone to go out and see it more films like this are exactly what we need sf	positive
its great i loved it ha cause i love dinosaurs they r the greatest animals but i loved the show cause it wasn't copied from another show and it was a originals ha it has a good storyline and great for little kids if they like dinosaurs that is i have a few downs too its not all that great cause of the dinosaurs look a little mutated so i should have had but a 7 but right now is a little late for that yay 4 more lines to go it is great for a fantasy show though warning this might spoil a part for u so if u don't want it to be spoiled don't read on plz near the end is kinda weird cause all they need to do is get dang i forgot what it was so nvm guess its not a spoiler so never mind i loved it and its my opinion and sorry for any missed spelled words if any	positive
i laughed a lot while watching this it's an amusing short with a fun musical act and a lot of wackiness the characters are simple but their simplicity adds to the humor stylization the dialog is funny and often unexpected and from the first line to the last everything just seems to flow wonderfully there's max who has apparently led a horrible life and there's edward who isn't sure what life he wants to lead my favorite character was tom edward's insane boss tom has a short role but a memorable one highly recommended for anyone who likes silly humor and you can find it online now which is a bonus i am a fan of all of jason's cartoons and can't wait to see what he comes out with next	positive
it's been awhile since i've seen cold mountain bit i do knew that i enjoyed it immensely though it does take place during the the last days of american civil war it's not really a war movie it's more of a romance drama and it works mainly because of the performances usually i don't like nicole kidman but i liked here i thought she was very convincing in her role i liked rene zelwegger as well who i'm not usually a fan of jude law is good as usual the supporting cast there are some great supporting performances her too numerous too mention there's also some breathtaking scenery in the film and there are also a number of very nice musical pieces as well the story is sad and tinged with tragedy but it s a beautifully done well told story for me cold mountain is an 8 10	positive
1st the good news the 3 d is spectacularly well done and they don't go for the gotcha gimmicks the film is based on the true story of the high point in human history and even features one of the actual participants in that story buzz aldrin and now the meat of the matter it's about flies for krissakes flies with big googy human eyes true but flies nonetheless remember when i likened the underworld movies to rats vs cockroaches that wasn't intended as praise and i never dreamed anyone would take it literally this one's got even less empathy going for it baby maggots ugh in one of those odd confluences of hollywood groupthink this flik was evidently on the drawing boards at the same time as space chimps also about critters in space go rent apollo 13 and see a 9 rated movie about the real space program rip	negative
this film has some flaws and most of those flaws are a lack of anything happening possibly the greatest film to show the direness within fly over country rolling kansas is a film in which nothing happens and you don't care about anybody like life it starts it moves and then it ends a few attempts at humor are made but everything falls very flat the occasional cameo just reminds the viewer that they could be wasting their life doing something besides watching this movie and the one rock song they bought and used at every single instance do yourself a favor and go see a good movie this is free and repeatedly frequently on comedy central because nobody went to see it nobody wants to see it and it's marginally better than dead air not to damn with faint praise but the movie's one rock song is worth listening to too bad the movie isn't worth watching	negative
although dig was being hailed as being closest to what the music industry is like it is highly fabricated the director has misled the audience into believing the brian jonestown massacre disappeared off the face of the earth post '98 and the rivalry between the dandy warhols and jonestown has been milked the truth of the matter is not really exposed in this film that said this film is endlessly quotable and is an interesting watch as we get a look at two groups of very talented musicians creating their art one of the best things this film has going for it is a unique perspective between the indie music scene and the larger corporate scene recommended mostly for the music and the two fantastic bands	positive
i gave this film an 10 10 with some reluctance as it's hard to praise something that so haunted and terrified me for years the sheer menace on the woman in black's face is just pure horror and the accompanying music just worsens the dread i saw this when it was first on tv when i was 10 and it really did disturb me for years i'm fascinated by the fact that so many other users have said this too so many movie reviews go on about how disturbing or terrifying a film might be but you can believe all those who have posted on this board this really is incredibly powerful stuff i mean i really like horror films and generally find them quite funny more often than not but this really is menacing and will probably disturb most people i haven't seen it since i was 10 and i'm tempted to watch it again but fear i might have some sleepless nights i can't quite put my finger on what it is exactly but i think it's something to do with the fact that fear is the woman's greatest weapon and that we as viewers are just as susceptible as we feel the fear so intensely it's remarkable that other viewers' feelings are so unanimous i've also seen the stage play which was an excellent production but nothing can compare to this	positive
this is an exquisite film about the search for some bliss in everyday life the pacing the camera work the emotion the haunting musical score and the pure charm of this picture make it a must see it isn't easily appreciated by the immature or emotionally stunted the only flaw i can see about this film is that it wasn't captured in a more technically perfect film format it deserved todd ao technicolor and the very finest sound format available an intimate film can be made in seventy millimeter the gorgeous italian villas effect on its inhabitants would have rendered even more lushly and the small lovely moments would be even more beautifully seen and heard as it is it still demands attention as a sweet moving small film i can't stop myself from watching it every time it comes on satelite the transformations of the characters from contained tight and mistrustful is always a joy to watch and i really should recommend it more often the casting is perfect the mood is perfect the acting is above reproach it is a film about middle age and the choices people make it is deep and thoughtful without beating the viewer up with heavy handedness watch it in one sitting and let it have its effect on you if you don't get it perhaps you haven't lived enough or something else is wrong with you	positive
this movie has a very hard to swallow premise even by this genre's standards we are asked to accept not only that a record played backwards can bring a dead man back to life but that the record also contains hidden messages aimed specifically at one kid when the singer had no connection to the boy when he was alive and of course no way of knowing at whose hands the record would end up anyway the film is fun for a while but eventually the silliness and the pointlessness reign supreme if they were really trying to create a new freddy like horror icon they were way off the villain here has no personality no motivation and no variety 1 2	negative
if you are planning to watch 'partner' and are on imdb reading reviews about it you have already wasted too much time over this stupid idiotic awful movie it's a horrible horrible horrible copy of the movie 'hitch ' i choose to ignore all the other warnings and bad reviews i had heard about this movie and wasted a precious 20 minutes on it i thought that after all its david dhawan who is making it and it has govinda how bad can it be but after 20 minutes of watching this nonsense i couldn't take it any more and turned off my computer overacting by everyone in the movie stupid dialogues total time waste i gave it a 1 star rating because that's the lowest you can do if i could go lower i would have given it a 100 rating	negative

well easily my favourite tv series ever call me a walking mail cliché but include violence mafia sex gambling drugs etc on a show and you're already winning points on in my book combine all that with acting that superceeds anything you've ever seen on the small screen add directing that fits cinema of the vintage type and most of all writing that blows the mind and a few brains a long the way and you got yourself a show thats gonna be pretty tough to compete with above all stand two actors james gandolfini as tony soprano and edie falco as his wife carmela as for gandolfini he fits his roll in a way that words cannot express if you haven't seen him as tony yet see it now i can go on and on and on about every character in the show the psychological brilliance the gripping scenes etc but you wouldn't be able to stop me so all i can say is that this is about the only show along with seinfeld that i am able to watch over and over again from start to finish and end up enjoying it even more	positive
legend of zu is possibly the most exciting movie ive seen in recent years it transcends all expectations and is truly a work of art with unmatched visual sceneries and story of divine proportions legend of zu proceeds to blow over its viewers with its majesty this movie is wonderously crafted through the use of high tech cgi which allows fans of the fantasy genre to see their visions come to life the acting is perfect for this type of movie if you were an immortal with supernatural powers i would think you'd keep more to yourself unlike the comments of many the plot is actually quite easy to follow while maintaining a quick pace that adds a sense of urgency anyone that cannot keep track of the different characters simply must not be paying attention since or are used to such levels of sophistication as the titanic the plot is engaging and layered with themes so epic that they will leave you gasping for air legend of zu is on a level of greatness so high that perhaps many people are put off by its grandeur allow yourself to be completely engulfed within its fantastical vision and you will grow to love this movie	positive
the main point of the movie imo is the fact the joanna's whole life has been nothing but a series of facades the movie opens up with her secretly dying her gray roots and hiding the used kit in an empty tissue box what is strange is that she is hiding this from her husband if she has to hide mundane things from her loved one one can bet that she is hiding even bigger things from others involved in her life when joanna accidentally hits cory she leaves the scene to call the police by the time she returns the police and ambulance are there as well as people from her community remarking what kind of person hits a child then just leaves her there well respected in her community she makes the decision to keep quiet about what she had done but she never realized how difficult it would be the keep up her facades great movie i have seen it many times	positive
this is one of the most daring and important of the so called pre code films made in hollywood during the 1930s unlike some pre code films that occasionally dabbled in subjects that would have never been allowed after 1934 5 this film fully immersed itself in a very sordid yet entertaining plot from start to finish the conventional morality of the late 30s and 40s was definitely not evident in this film as the film is essentially about a conniving woman who sleeps her way to the top and with no apologies along the way this broad both enjoyed sex and used it on every man who could help her get rich something you just never would have seen in films made just two or three years later the film begins with barbara stanwyck working in her father's speakeasy in addition to being her boss he is also her pimp and encourages her to sleep with a local government official so that he'll allow the illegal bar to operate with impunity while not especially clear here it appears as if daddy has been renting his daughter's body out for a long time however after nearly being raped and attacking this man by breaking a bottle of beer over his skull barbara has had enough and heads to the big city it doesn't hurt that the still blew up and killed her father but her feeling that she was whoring herself out and had nothing to show for it appeared to be the impetus to move despite the depression barbara uses sex to get a job at a huge mega bank she starts out at a pretty menial job as a file clerk but in the space of what seems like just a few weeks she sleeps her way from one job to another to yet another until she is sleeping with the head of the bank and his future son in law this all ends in tragedy but babs doesn't seem too shook up over the deaths of these two men in fact some time later she is able to insinuate herself into the life of the new ceo and once again she's on top perhaps in more way than one now so far this is a wonderful movie because it was so gritty and unrepentant barbara played a 100 sociopath a woman with no morality and no conscience just a desire to squeeze as much out of life as she could no matter who she hurt in the process however the brave writers and producer chickened out and thought it important to tack on a redemptive ending considering that this woman was so evil and conniving her change of heart at the end was a major disappointment and strongly detracted from the film in many ways this reminded me of the ending of jezebel as once again a wicked person somehow sees the light and changes at the not too convincing conclusion my advice is to try watching red headed woman and downstairs red headed woman is much like baby face but features no magical transformation at the end the leading lady really is a skunk down deep in downstairs a film very much like red headed woman the roles are reversed and a man john gilbert plays a similar conniving character both are classics and a bit better than this film this film is an amazing curio of a brief period of often ultra sleazy hollywood films and in this light it's well worth seeing for cinephiles also fans of the duke take note john wayne plays a very small part in the film and it's very unusual to see a very young wayne playing such a conventional role	positive
i don't think i've really ever given walter matthau his due as a comedic performer he's certainly been wonderful in plenty of lighthearted roles but i guess i always put his success down to his characters' grumpiness and ruthlessness a gruff contrast to the flamboyant personality of his frequent co star jack lemmon and i suppose a natural extension of his earlier work in dramatic pictures watching gene saks' 'the odd couple 1968 ' adapted from a popular neil simon play the realisation suddenly clicked matthau is in his own right absolutely hilarious initially striking the audience as filthy crude and generally unappealing his oscar madison eventually manages to worm his way into our hearts culminating in a hilariously overplayed confession of emotions that matthau rasps out in a voice not entirely his own at the same time while holding his own as a comedian his interplay with lemmon is of course pitch perfect indeed the film rightly belongs to both actors who have never failed to light up the cinema screen by themselves let alone together calling to mind billy wilder's screenplay for 'the apartment 1960 ' this neil simon comedy builds itself around around a rather morbid premise compulsive house cleaner felix unger lemmon having just been evicted by his wife of twelve years attempts to commit suicide but fruitlessly abandons the idea after he wrecks his back trying to open the hotel window dejected he arrives at the house of good friend oscar matthau a divorced slob who lives alone on a diet of potato crisps and green sandwiches that might contain either very new cheese or very old meat oscar kindly offers felix a place to stay but is soon overwhelmed by his friend's finicky personality and constant insistence on absolute cleanliness the pair form an unusual sort of marital arrangement with felix assuming the role of the effeminate and constantly nagging wife and oscar as the sloppy unappreciative husband who always comes home later than he's supposed to this is a marriage that barely lasts three weeks and by the end of it we can completely sympathise with felix's ex wife who remains unseen 'the odd couple' is a terrific comedy most of all because it has a lot of heart for all their arguing it's obvious that the two roommates have plenty of affection for each other most movingly seen when felix tries to launch into a furious tirade instead perhaps inadvertently ending up informing oscar how tops he his the pair's four poker buddies john fiedler herb edelman david sheiner and larry haines are also constantly badgering each other about some obscure annoyance but you can't deny that they've got the best of intentions their decision to treat felix as though nothing has happened to him may have sounded fine in theory but maybe being ignored wasn't quite the correct solution to felix's gloomy feelings of inadequacy and inconsequentiality unlike some comedies based on popular stage plays i was recently disappointed by wilder's 'the seven year itch 1955 this film doesn't simply strike at the same chord throughout and the relationship between the two leads is progressively developed through tears laughter and much disagreement	positive

i am a professional musician who was inspired nearly 20 years ago to begin playing guitar after hearing jimmy page on led zeppelin ii while i don't play in the same genre or style the impact of that man has been huge now nearly 20 years later i finally got to see something more than the not so good the song remains the same again i have seen so many bands perform some small some the current 'masters ' no band no where no way has ever been able to pull off the magic that you can actually taste by watching this dvd robert plant can be a bit much at times and you can nearly sense page's annoyance for him forgetting lyrics but that didn't matter i guess especially for the era bonham's genius shines more on this dvd then on any album with zeppelin the band of joy or lord sutch jpj is pretty ordinary but the magic of this dvd is how well the four of them perform together the world loved to imagine that they were into black magic k etc that was only a matter of interest to page the magic notice i say this a lot is that this dvd captures a rare glance to the rawness of 4 young boys who can play brilliantly no matter how sloppy they are actually playing it didn't matter a quick breakdown the first of the two dvd's is where the true magic is you should be able to sense the power and rawness zep had in their early days by the end of the second dvd page is struggling with his sanity during the knebworth songs it's no secret that by this time he was severely addicted to heroin so i'd recommend the first disk to any music lover and the second for the only true zeppelin fan i may be going too far here for some guitarists but i would say after watching this page is certainly more creative and inventive than hendrix yup i said it and if you disagree watch the dvd	positive
first of all ed wood jr is not the worst director ever plan 9 from outer space not withstanding coleman francis deserves that title i present exhibit b glen or glenda the first half of the movie consists of a surprisingly thoughtful exploration of crossdressing especially since it was made in 1953 the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well this is not to say the movie doesn't have problems bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines poor bela looked like even he wasn't sure what was happening at times the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie the long dream sequence that makes up the middle of the film was totally bizarre more like a vaguely menacing stag film than a dream sequence the alan ann story the supposed original focus of the film has a tacked on quality about it no ed wood jr is not the worst director ever he was able at least for part of this movie to make an earnest social statement when coleman francis tried to do that in night train to mundo fine aka red zone cuba it just ended in chaos glen or glenda is at least watchable without robot help	negative
i'm gettin' sick of movies that sound entertaining in a one line synopsis then end up being equal to what you'd find in the bottom center of a compost heap who knows witchery may have sounded interesting in a pitch to the studios even with a big name cast like blair and hasselhoff wink wink nudge nudge and the effervescent likes of hildegard knef i dunno some woman but on film it just falls apart faster than a papier mache sculpture in a rainstorm seems these unfortunate folks are trapped in an island mansion off the eastern seaboard and one of them a woman i'd guess is being targeted by a satanic cult to bear the child of hell while the others are offed in grotesque tortuous ways okay right there you have a cross section of plots from the exorcist the omen ten little indians and a few other lesser movies in the satanic worshippers run amok line none of it is very entertaining and for the most part you'll cringe your way from scene to scene until it's over no not even linda blair and david hasselhoff help matters much they're just in it to pick up a paycheck and don't seem very intent on giving it their all from the looks of it hasselhoff probably wishes he were back on the beack with pam anderson and who can blame him and linda well who knows a celebrity peta benefit or pro am golf tour or whatever it is she's in to nowadays and the torture scenes ecchhhh you'll see people get their mouths sewn shut dangled up inside roaring fireplaces strung up in trees during a violent storm vessels bursting out of their necks etc etc sheesh and i thought mark of the devil was the most sadistic movie i'd seen don't bother it's not worth your time i can't believe i told you as much as i did if you do watch it just see if you can count the cliches and yes blair gets possessed as if you didn't see that coming down main street followed by a marching band no stars witchery these witches will give you itches	negative

i saw this film when i was a young child on television thank you canadian broadcasting corporation and had nightmares about it for years afterwards trnka was one of the mentors for bratislav pojar one of canada's national film board's best animators pojar was in turn a mentor and collaborator for the great drouin if you like trnka you should see night angel the symbolism is obvious but deftly used the oppositions of beauty and life the plant are placed in opposition with the anonymity of the gloved hand the poor puppet hero is condemned despite a lack of political agenda what i most remembered was the feeling of oppression in the decor the small room where the action takes place is the character's entire world the invasion by the hand is a complete violation of that world beautiful and haunting film i found a copy of this and other wonderful shorts by trnka at the public library and showed it to my own kids a must see	positive
the first season told pretty much how all elements of the marine corps would operate i e ground air helicopters and jets as a team that's the season i give the high rating to true there are still a lot of liberties taken in season 1 but the stories were more believable the subsequent seasons were a gawd awful attempt of melrose place meets top gun i was a marine stationed at miramar at the time and i remember them shooting the show around the san diego area i got to talk to rod rowland and james brolin rowland's character was good to go brolin's character was good in the first season only for some reason he slacked off after the first ep of the second season if you want to see a little of how the marine air ground team operates then season one is the one to watch if you're into melrose place and soap opera like plots with an attempt to merge them into top gun then see the last two seasons	positive
when we were in junior high school some of us boys would occasionally set off stinkbombs it was considered funny then but the producers directors and cast of semana santa angel of death in the dvd section of your local video rental are adults and they are still setting them off like the previous reviewer who wondered if the cast were anxious to get off the set and home i doubt more than one take was done for any of the scenes mira sorvino hot in mighty aphrodite and other top rated films seems to have undersold herself to this project her acting is non existent confined mostly to wistful stares that are supposed to indicate how sensitive she is to the plight of the film's various victims but let me warn you do not be the next victim step away from the dvd if you find it on the shelf tbere are not many good leg shots of mira the only high points i could find in the film and the supporting cast is of inferior quality delivering a mishmash of badly done dialogue with embarrassing spanish accents worthy of the best high school theatrical production	negative
there have been many movies about people returning home from wars and having to cope but the war at home is worth seeing portraying vietnam vet jeremy collier emilio estevez having trouble connecting with his texas family much of the movie is very likely to tense you up but nothing can prepare you for what ends up getting revealed part of what makes this movie so good is how it gives the viewer the feeling of both texas and of the generation gap jeremy's parents bob martin sheen and maurine kathy bates clearly have a problem with their son's attitude both about the war and his rejection of americanism his sister karen kimberly williams is uncertain with whom to side but after the dinner there can be no neutrality so we as americans may never be able to fully get over the vietnam war but this movie can probably help us look seriously at how it affected so many people emilio estevez certainly did a good job directing also starring corin nemec and carla gugino	positive
with all due respect to joel fabiani and rosemary nicolls and their characters department s will be forever associated with peter wyngarde's jason king most people remember him as this camp flamboyant and debonair womaniser cum detective in the mould of austin powers but that will do a disservice to the character he's far more nuanced than that jason king is lazy he often lets stewart fight all the bad guys and only chips in at the end he is egotistical his appreciation of people is based on whether they've read his novels or not a lot of his detective work is speculation without facts to back them up and he sulks whenever annabelle is right and she often is he's clearly a man having a mid life crisis and drink drives but jason king is brilliant if wyngarde had played him purely as a dashing hero it wouldn't have worked but he shows king often as a paper tiger led by his libido love of finery and prone to grandstanding and it gets in the way of his detective work at times but he has some of the best lines and put downs in tv history and by not playing him as whiter than white the chemistry and interactions between the three lead characters is all the better for it watching it again on dvd recently you get to see just how much depth wyngarde put into jason king	positive
let's see i'm trying to practice finding the positive in everything so what kind thing can i say about the pallbearer i know the performances were no that won't work as they succeeded in draining all personality from gwyneth paltrow usually so vibrant and ended up creating caricatures out of carol kane and barbara hershey oh how 'bout the story nope that isn't gonna fly either as it was doze inducing what was the genre anyway it wasn't funny that rules out comedy it wasn't interesting enough to be dramatic was that a romance between schwimmer and paltrow i have to ask as i can't be sure let's just call it losers in like i'm sure those behind this film started with a vision i mean they must have had one to pitch to the studio suits but i need help finding it even if i were a patient person who could forgive the pure stupidity of the story i couldn't in good conscience recommend a film that allows a guy to go into a professional job interview in a windbreaker and messy fluffy stupid hair speaking of hair are we supposed to be amused by the deliberate black roots and platinum locks worn by hershey what am i doing i already lost 97 irretrievable minutes in the actual watching of the movie i cannot devote any more time to this loser	negative

i saw the grudge yesterday and wow i was really scared a good thing i love horror movies and i really liked this one there were so many 'surprise' scenes what's the english word that made you jump in your seat though too much screaming from the audience made it difficult not to laugh i think the most scary scene was on the bus when the face flashes by on the window or when yoko's walking without her chin the make up is also very good sometimes you could really see it was there but it was still adding a freaky look to the scene the boy was very good indeed so cute without make up and so terribly scary with it on the next time i hear a cracking noise i will probably feel pretty scared	positive

this is truly a documentary of love about a fascinating character her outlook on life and her extended family the filmmakers spent three years taping sister helen at her halfway house and managed to capture so much wonderful material that you can not help but feel you know sister helen and her boys the house holds 21 recovering addicts each with a story almost as involving as sister helen's the ending scenes are particularly involving and emotional sister helen's story of marriage addiction and loss reveals a very complex character who's tough love is at all times funny touching and endearing the film is a amazing in the way it tells its story in wonderful slice of life sequences which develop into a story that is almost as clear as if each scene were scripted and acted by the best the honesty and obvious dishonesty of the clients is very involving as you learn of their fears and watch their attempts to grow you will never forget sister helen robert moe or poor ashish spelling	positive

i was very impressed with this film i would have to rate it as one of the better classic era westerns i say that for the whole thing the acting mature dialog no nonsense story and excellent cinematography director anthony mann who did several well photographed film noirs around this same era also made some westerns such as this one it has that same film noir look mann and jimmy stewart collaborated on several westerns during this period if you like this movie i recommend the mann stewart film bend of the river in a nutshell the story is about a man lin mcadam stewart who owns this prestigious winchester 73 rifle a weapon he won fair and square in a contest it is then stolen and passed on from villain to villain all of those villains are interesting characters aiding stewart act out this interesting tale are shelley winters dan duryea stephen mcnally millard mitchell charles drake will greer and j c flippen all of them are fun to watch it was a bit of a stretch however to see rock hudson playing an indian young bull but you can't have everything	positive
even if i had not read anne rice's queen of the damned from the vampire chronicles i probably would still have thought this movie was just awful it was tasteless plot less it made absolutely no sense at all i sat for a while pondering the plot disassociated from the book and the longer i thought of it the worse it was to associate it in any way with the prior chronicles film is ridiculous as it is ridiculously inconsistent with that movie let alone the book the bare few ideas taken from rice's genius in the vampire chronicles were butchered and ridiculed it is an absolute insult to anne rice fans everywhere and such a pathetic excuse for a legacy in being aaliyah's last film truly it's an insult to aaliyah fans as well possibly the only compliment can be paid to the sound effects as well as some of the graphics good as they may be it is still not at all enough to make me regret the time spent watching this movie as a matter of fact i signed up for this membership for the sole reason of communicating to people bothering to look at this film 7 years after the release as it may be to not waste their time or expect much beyond disappointment	negative
you want to see the movie the gamers by dead gentlemen productions this is not that movie this movie is not funny it is a waste of time all of the good comments here seem to be written by poorly disguised false third parties the people who made this movie seem to be attempting to synthesize fake interest this movie is not a well done mockumentary comparisons to spinal tap or christopher guest are insulting the movie is so mean spirited that i cannot imagine anyone familiar with the subject matter finding it funny being able to laugh at yourself is an important quality but if you are the ones being lampooned in this manner you'd have to hate yourself to enjoy it the movie is not offensive because of its grand satire of taboo topics but because of its constant pathetic banality	negative
this movie should be shown to film school students as an example of what not to do the original kicked some major tire squealing butt this horrible disaster breaks the cardinal rule of bruckheimer films which is we all know they suck but they have great action this film has no action this film is boring where are the cars where are the chases where's the tension where's the suspense where's the rush where this isn't really a movie at all it's a bad commercial 50 cars in 24 hours that is wrong they have 3 days to steal them the ad is wrong how bad is that the leads acting is stiff wooden and forced the villain the cop the others who cares they utter their pointless lines they serve the illogical plot they slog through it the best they can as the music video director says don't worry we'll make a lot of fast cuts and no one will notice how bad the film is or we'll fix it with lots of loud music the script isn't really a script at all it's more like a list of cliches with an ending that is a total ripoff of warning possible spoiler 5 4 3 2 1 the fugitive the biggest crime of all is the underuse of vinnie jones man this is the baddest coolest mofo since jules in pulp fiction and what do they do they make him a mute who's hardly in the film make vinnie the main villain and he could have saved the film how could they have been so dumb how how why the original film is very entertaining with a cool trick at the end that gets the driver away the original has a great 40 minute chase that delivers go find the original or if you're craving some real car chase action go rent ronin the chases in ronin raised the bar by which all other car chases will now be judged bruckheimer and cage had all that money all those resources all that experience and they can't even come close to matching a film made 25 years ago for 250 000 how can that be you feel like you got ripped off after seeing this movie where i was once excited to see coyote ugly remember the titans and pearl harbor now i say god help us all	negative
mishima a life in four chapters is in my opinion the best paul schrader film to this day mesmorizing cinematography accompanied with philip glass mystical musical score added a completely magical aura to the story of one of the japan's greatest novelists whose originality and picturesque narrative are beautifully portrayed in this picture as any gifted character mishima was troubled with severe self conflicts the main of them being the conflict between the pen and a sword as the director puts it in his final chapter or the struggle between the sensitive poet with homosexual feelings living in a notoriously masculine society with centuries long warrior traditions thus widening the gap between the sensitive and the militantly traditional side of mishima himself all schrader's films and the ones he wrote scripts for are basically stories of the inside conflict within a man that doesn't belong in an environment he lives in that also goes for mishima who apart from japanese military school upbringing is brought up with love for theater and words his demise consisted of both of these key points in his life it was about words and theatrical ending in a life long play film like this comes along once in a long while and most will have to wait a lifetime to reach this beauty 20 out of 10	positive
come on fantastic drama on screen are you joking folks i wouldn't put horrible molly gross to play even in school play where did these people learn acting borrowing some papers from their neighbors actor terrible plot awful acting heh why do you take us for an imbeciles what can i say more i understand this is an tv production and the acting is not supposed to be the one from citizen kane but nevertheless they should try it harder in order to earn their money and apart from that what can be said in 10 lines for a simple movie like this u wanna article in the morning paper to say what worse film in the decade ok you want it you got it	negative
this apology for a movie is about absolutely nothing rachel griffiths must have needed the money the film must have been made on a very low budget because the lighting was non existent i made a vow if i ever see pete postlesumthingor other i'll commit suicide i'd be happy to know if there was 1 a plot or 2 a script my biggest regret is i wasted my time watching this rubbish	negative

a bondage humiliation s m show and not much else the plot is flat really just a banal setup for the stylishly depraved set pieces the host of the aforementioned show a silly little man who spouts drivel while prancing around the stage in dresses was almost as painfully distracting as the attempts at artful editing the dream like ending felt tacked on to the film's credit though aya sugimoto was fairly convincing as the tortured lead flower and snake has been compared with eyes wide shut but aside from some minor surface similarities kubrick's is easily the more layered artistic and atmospheric picture	negative
while the title before the devil knows you're dead comes from an irish proverb the film plays out like a greek tragedy it all starts with a botched robbery and continues to spiral out of control as two brothers attempt to escape the mess they've gotten themselves into the cast is well assembled with philip seymour hoffman ethan hawke playing the aforementioned brothers notable support includes albert finney as their father and marisa tomei as the wife of one brother and lover of the other beyond these principals the acting is unremarkable the story is compelling and is told with a certain degree of verve the narrative structure keeps things interesting by providing different points of view and frequent time shifts that being said the film's unpredictability is somewhat muted since it becomes apparent early on that this story is a tragedy through and through all in all a pretty impressive debut for first time screenwriter kelly masterson sidney lumet's direction is well handled but i'm more impressed by the fact that he's still directing at over eighty years old i was less impressed by the score by carter burwell but it isn't a major distraction in the end the film proves to be compelling viewing and while the story presentation may have superficial similarities to other films this one remains a unique experience	positive
first the positives an excellent job at depicting urban landscapes to suit the mood of the film some of the shots could be paintings by de chirico sophie marceau beautiful the negatives the stories are hard to believe unreal uni dimensional characters preen and posture 100 of the time as if they were in some kind of catwalk this is neither the antonioni of his earlier much better movies nor the wenders we've all come to know and appreciate malkovich is excess baggage in this movie	positive
i have wracked my brain for another film that reminds me of this one i really can't come up with one i think it's because most of the films that take on this topic war peace violence are in a fixed documentary style there are some terrific ones out there all of them better known than usa t m i'm sure but they are intended to be informational and to bring your emotional response to the surface through intellectual means this dvd in some ways may seem more intellectual but it really isn't it is philosophical maybe but it bypasses the information mode and goes directly to the same place that a piece of music does it makes you feel but sometimes you don't even know why you are just taken somewhere on a wave of feeling when you watch it notice how well it is put together it may not be for everyone but it is for everyone who look for a rare cinematic creation that respects you	positive
another downey must see if you are an obsessed fan like me you have got to see this movie he plays alex finch a 22 year old yale grad who realizes that the life he just came into is the life he left 26 years earlier alex is the re incarnation of louie jeffries a no nonsense lawyer happily married to corrine cybil sheppard louie is killed on their one year anniversary when he is hit by a car he demands to go back only this time in the body of alex finch enter robert downey jr a lot of confusion and a lot of laughs although this movie is 15 years old it still makes you wonder if there really is such a thing as re incarnation and if so how often to you meet the same souls life after life i don't know the answer but i do know that you need to see this movie it is a riot and downey looks so good in a tuxedo this film makes you believe in love and true love never dies it just gets recycled	positive
for starters hobgoblins tries to ape the more successful gremlins that's bad enough but they don't even try to make anything that closely resembles a movie here instead it's more like a bargain basement everything must go clearance of embarrassing scenes inappropriate sound fx acting as bland as unflavored tapioca and a script that takes everything humans hold sacred in their motion pictures and throws 'em down the old tube aroo the plot grrrr meddling kids track down gremlin like creatures from movie lot before they kill people by projecting their fantasies sound cool does it well see that wall on the other side of your room run right at it top speed face first see that is cooler than this movie you dare to doubt quick name something else one of the leads has been in other than this what other scripts have the writers done since hobgoblins name another rick sloane directoral effort how many hobgoblins action figures do you have see thank you i cannot believe i took so long to write about such a horrible film i'd rather write about more important things like the separation of church and state economic restructuring in europe that kind of thing but no hobgoblins it is and it is bad bad like your grandparents' wallpaper bad as pink flamingos on your lawn bad like underwear that says home of the whopper and i think we'll stop there well mike and the robots fight valiantly but try as they might they can do only so much with hobgoblins before they realize that yes the director does need kicked in the shin real real hard one star for hobgoblins seven stars for the mst3k version	negative

i'll keep this one quite short i believe that this is an extraordinary movie i see other reviewers who have commented to the effect that it's badly written poorly shot has a terrible soundtrack and worse that it's not real in its portrayal of life ok so it may not be quite believable for its whole length but this movie carries a message of hope which some others seemed to have missed hope that it isn't too late to save people from the terrible things that go on in so many lives gangland violence is real right is it right no this movie carries an important social message which the cynics may dislike but which nonetheless is to be praised rather than denigrated i have watched this movie with great enjoyment at least eight times each time with equal enjoyment and each time with the feeling that maybe the world could be made better and is not beyond saving well not until 2008 anyway 9 out of 10 from me for this one it's very nearly perfect in my view jmv	positive
watched uzumaki last night and right away was reminded of two early peter weir films from australia the last wave and picnic at hanging rock they were films loaded with atmosphere but short on actual horror uzumaki to me seems clearly influenced by these films it has a number of fairly mundane scenes that become more portentous the deeper you are sucked in by the film it also has more scenes of outright horror and although i don't think the film actually measures up to those two films it is well worth the time of most thoughtful fans of the unusual not necessarily horror 7 out of 10 seems fair but i must say that years after seeing the last wave the film still stays with me and it is precisely picnic at hanging rock's unresolved ending that makes it so haunting p s all the people criticizing the acting pullleasse in this genre	positive
it's always nice to see angela bassett getting to do a role that she can really sink her teeth into she is at times intense funny and even sexy in her role as lena a colored woman forced to make a home on a desolate mudbank just outside of cape town south africa danny glover is also good in a not entirely sympathetic role as her partner boesman willie jonah gives a finely nuanced performance as the stranger that discovers boesman and lena's new living area it's not often that you get a chance to see an intelligent film dealing with mature themes although it is based on a play the late director john berry who also directed claudine opens the material up by having the film shot in the widescreen cinemascope format he also keeps things visually interesting through the creative blocking of actors and by showing us things only mentioned in the play just like diahann carroll in claudine john berry may have directed angela bassett into an academy award nomination this is definitely a film worth searching for	positive
for the life of me i can not understand the blind hype and devotion to this totally unbelievable movie and i think i have the qualifications to say so i am a former special operations soldier with 14 years in the lifestyle this movie was totally totally unreal and obviously written by someone that did very little research into life in the army in combat or at a team or platoon level three eod guys trouncing around bagdad on their own get real no chain of command get real eod clearing buildings get real eod military intelligence sniper qualified buck sergeant get real wait i shot and killed a bad guy and then let two guys take me without firing another shot or being injured at all get real i carjack an iraqi civilian while i am only armed with a 9 mil break into another civilians house get punked by his wife then make it back to camp on foot in the middle of bagdad at night without as so much as a scratch or confrontation get real there is absolutely no adherence to military protocol army and no resemblance at all to any army unit that i have even encountered totally unbelievable and disrespectful to the men and women of eod who contrary to this poor film are not wild adrenaline seeking yahoos but extremely qualified professionals doing an incredibly hard job	negative
this is the columbo that got directed by steven spielberg at an early point in his career it's nothing sensational but some small hint of great things to come for spielberg can be seen in this movie the movie is basically in the same style as most of spierlberg's '70's movies and tv works so that means that some characters tend to show some quirkiness's and no i'm not just talking about the columbo character alone the kind of character quirkiness which perhaps can be best seen in the 1975 spielberg movie jaws but other than some small hints of typical early spielberg elements you can't call this movie the work of and fine example of a rising director star not that its bad of course it isn't but as i said earlier it also isn't anything too sensational this movie began really well and very promising but after it's fine opening in which as always the murder occurred the movie became sort of more slow and also dull to watch dull because it's mostly a columbo movie by the book that doesn't have real memorable moments in it not dull because it's a boring movie to watch the murder itself was quite ingenious and the concept of having a crime story writer murdering his writing partner showed some great and interesting potential the story however didn't really explored all of its possibilities at least that's the feeling this movie left me with the movie was still a good one to watch nevertheless thanks to the character of jack cassidy who thinks he's smarter then columbo due to his mystery crime writing experience and tries to give him all kinds of possible hints leading away from himself but of course columbo knows better and he is his number one suspect from the first moment on but he as usual plays the game along the movie does have a good overall style and uses some fine camera position and editing funny to see that also most of this was all mostly consistent with spielberg's later work especially some of the camera angles a fine and perfectly watchable columbo movie but don't let the name of spielberg attached to it rise your expectations for it too highly 7 10	positive
i rented this dvd having seen it while looking for something else when i saw the title on the jacket i couldn't believe my eyes i read yalom's book about a year ago and loved it in fact admire yalom's work in general i am a clinical psychologist i have watched perhaps 30 minutes of this movie and have had to turn it off i'm not sure if i can take much more at a superficial level the faux accents as others have commented are simply distracting at best and irritating and vapid at worst the acting is dull when it should be passionate and comical when it should be serious the portrayal of lou salome is simply flippant and the brilliant freud comes off as little more than a schoolboy i see very little of the book's spirit conveyed thus far i had hoped to be able to recommend this film to my students instead i will refer them to the book imagine that	negative
it takes a little while to get used to nick nolte's nebraskan locutions before we can easily accept him as a famous intercontinental playwright once you get past the bar it turns into a fascinating story of a man who loses everything while trying to do good nolte an american moves to germany marries a famous actress and is a satisfied success in every respect until war is about to break out he's visited by a jovial american john goodman who persuades him to accept a post as an anti semitic radio broadcaster for the nazis nolte has no politics but thinks it's a challenge to write a role that's almost impossible and then play it himself another american secret agent will modify nolte's radio scripts inserting a cough here a sneeze there that will serve as a code for the transmission of intelligence to the allies there's a catch though nobody will know about nolte's real role as an american agent except goodman donovan and roosevelt himself if he's ever uncovered he'll be refused recognition by the americans nolte plunges ahead and his vicious broadcasts are wildly popular in germany his adored wife sheryl lee knows nothing of what's going on nor does she care nolte and lee live in what he repeatedly refers to as a nation of two the war ends and the trouble begins he's captured by americans who are bitter because of his betrayal they beat him and leave him in the mud he's rescued by goodman his fairy godmother who sends him to an anonymous existence in greenwich village and sends him a little cash now and then by 1960 he manages to cultivate a friendship with his neighbor the painter alan arkin who has also lost his family and claims the two now belong to a secret brotherhood but his location and his identity somehow leak out and he is more or less adopted by a group of ancient aryan racists led by a dentist and a priest his house front and mailbox are painted with swastikas and accusations he's beaten senseless by an ex gi but miraculously his beloved wife is returned to him by the ancient aryans another catch it turns out later that it's not his wife but rather her younger sister who has loved him since adolescence the ending has him typing his memoirs in an israeli jail in 1967 before his trial for crimes against humanity it's not a happy ending nolte can talk with but not see the occupant of the cell above his in jail it's adolf eichmann eichmann seems pleasant enough he advises nolte that it's a bad habit to type for fifteen straight hours it's important to relax you must learn to relax nolte laughs out loud and shouts that's how i got here the film is filled with such ironies at one point in their relaxed conversations arkin tells him that in spite of everything i still think people are good at heart i don't know if the movie was a commercial success but if it wasn't that's the sort of thing that might have torpedoed it for a younger audience of theater goers who may never have heard of anne frank let alone that supposedly final statement in her diary the fact is that it's a movie for adults and patient adults at that the story moves slowly there's very little violence no car chases no shootings and people don't seem subject to manic speech pressure a lot of it will probably slip past viewers who don't open themselves to its deliberate approach nolte refers to the war time relationship between him and his wife as a nation of two this is a pretty compact phrase no doubt anyone could come up with a glib definition but it takes a little concentration to grasp its emotional import it's a story of a man who loses everything his ability to write his identity his wife twice his sole friend his country his self respect at one point he stops walking along a crowded new york street and simply stands there until after dark when he is moved along by a curious cop the reason he stopped is that he simply has no place to go what vonnegut is describing is far more than depression i don't mean to sound condescending but it's the sort of feeling that's hard to understand in your youth adolescents might like to think they know what's holding nolte in that one spot but it really requires maturity and the quickened sense of finiteness that only maturity can bring remember robert frost's line about home being the place that when you go there they have to take you in well no place will take nolte in	positive
the director and two stars of laura 1944 were reteamed for this solid policier dana andrews is the son of a criminal who becomes a cop to cut all ties with the past but cannot keep his inherited violent ways in check while interrogating suspects and one night he goes too far gene tierney is the estranged wife of his victim a decorated war hero who has become involved with the town's leading racketeer and andrews' no 1 nemesis gary merrill who had himself been the protégé of andrews snr as usual with preminger this is a well crafted movie with a notable opening credits sequence and enlivened by a good cast that also includes karl malden as andrews' incumbent superior tom tully as tierney's motor mouth taxi driver dad and neville brand as merrill's chief thug with notable support also coming from craig stevens as the slimy wife beating victim bert freed as andrews' sympathetic partner and robert f nolan as andrews' stern outgoing superior having already been warned by the latter to mend his ways or else andrews panics and impersonates stevens for a couple of hours following his murder to put the police on the in this case wrong tracks of merrill however after tully becomes the prime suspect by which time andrews and tierney are romantically involved the cop goes by himself in merrill's lair fully intending to get bumped off and 'frame' the racketeer for his own murder clearly the protagonist is a complex character and andrews rises to the challenge with a first rate characterization that is typically complemented by the in house fox noir style	positive
this movie as my chinese girlfriend informed me features two well known hong kong pop stars while this may make the movie a mere marketing stunt i found the acting acceptable and they're both cute the story is pretty poor overall the vampiric traits and weaknesses are however used in humorous ways and created some uniquely entertaining bits the quarreling between the two girls made me chuckle and this gave a fine balance together with the well executed action scenes to create an entertaining movie	positive
there are probably more people afraid of the dentist than of let's say little monsters or scary looking dolls which makes it a perfect subject for a horror movie really dr feinstone corbin bernsen has been a successful dentist for several years now but when he catches his wife cheating on him with the poolguy he snaps and he brings his anger and frustration to his work well give a mad dentist a drill and a mouth and you can probably guess what happens next as i said brilliant idea but not delivered as well as it should in particular the ending is a huge let down last note watch for mark ruffalo you can count on me eternal sunshine in this one 5 10	negative

wow i loved the whole series and am shocked at comments by people who thought it ended badly perhaps it waffled a bit in seasons 4 5 while remaining better than anything else on television but 6 and particularly 6b were beautiful permutations on the themes developed in the more muscular first three seasons 6b started with such a sombre mood and janice's always keen insight into the family angst that doom filled line about knowing tony's penchant for sitting and staring anyone who missed the implications of that for the rest of the series does not know tony melfi's discomfort over the psychiatric study and its references to the sociopath's self deluding sentimentality for pets and animals goes back to the first episodes of the series say with tony's panic attack over the ducks leaving his pool and resonates with phil's wave bye bye line to his grandchildren before the coup de grace of the final episode not to get into chase's dark humour i could go on and on but i'll just add that i thought the final show starting with the opening strains of vanilla fudge to supply the ironic foreshadow you keep me hangin' on to the terminal moments where tony fades back into complacency with his family in tow or blasts apart like aj's suv or phil's head were utterly utterly perfect the best tv ever pretty good in a dying medium pathologically supplying the jack off fantasies aj derides and then into which he promptly subsides a tip of the pork pie to mr chase	positive
this film easily rivals the emotional strength the dramatic impact and the top notch performances of 12 angry men i rented it on a whim and was amazed that i had not heard of it before i do not know if this was emilio estevez's directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord she is irritating and yet one can empathize with her at the same time there are some moments where i feel the plot slows a touch and the moments between estevez and his ex girlfriend almost seem written for another film estevez comes off as another character all together but those are minor complaints this film must be based on a true story or must have been written by someone who lived these experiences i rate it 8 out of a difficult 10	positive
carol's journey is a pleasure to watch for so many reasons the acting of clara lago is simply amazing for someone so young and she is one of those special actors who can say say much with facial expressions director imanol urbibe presents a tight and controlled film with no break in continuity thereby propelling the plot at a steady pace with just enough suspense to keep one wondering what the nest scene will bring the screenplay of angel garcia roldan is story telling at its best which it seems if the major purpose for films after all the plot is unpredictable yet the events as they unravel are completely logical perhaps the best feature of this film if to tell a story of the spanish civil war as it affected the people it was a major event of the 20th century yet hardly any americans know of it in fact in 40 years of university teaching i averaged about one student a semester who had even heard of it much less any who could say anything comprehensive about it and the overwhelming number of students were merit scholars all of which speaks to the enormous amount of censorship in american education so in one way this film is a good way to begin a study of that event keeping in mind that when one thread is pulled a great deal of history is unraveled the appreciation of this film is therefore in direct relation to the amount of one's knowledge to view this film as another coming of age movie is the miss the movie completely the left elbow index considers seven aspects of film acting production sets character development plot dialogue film continuity and artistry on a scale for 10 for very good 5 for average and 1 for needs help carol's journey is above average on all counts excepting dialogue which is rated as average the lei average for this film is 9 3 raised to a 10 when equated to the imdb scale i highly recommend this film for all ages	positive
if you want to see a movie that terribly mixes up one latin country with any other latin country the celestine prophecy is a good example 1 perú not even in its most violent times has not shown polices or soldiers as much as in this film this showed a country like el salvador when civil war since i'm a peruvian who lives in lima the capital of perú it was too funny to me seeing the police guards here there and everywhere 2 if you have a car in perú and you want or need to be a taxi driver just post a sticker with the word taxi on the front glass of your car and you can drive freely in peruvian streets there are taxi companies but their rates are quite expensive no need of yellow or a black white squared band on the doors of your car well taxis in this film have that band somethin that you will never see in perú 3 peruvian people are not caribbean styled clothing for example when a taxi driver comes out he was wearing a guayabera cuban shirt a white hat and 40's mustaches like clark gable not one peruvian man looks like that please perú is not the caribbeans 4 a scene shows a woman on a street with a quite long skirt like the typical folklore dresses in latin america take a walk anywhere in perú and you'll never find a woman wearing like that unless you are watching a typical dance 5 cast could've been better i can not deny héctor elizondo is a great actor but he's not a latin actor his father was basque and his mother from puerto rico but he was born in new york and his spanish is not fluent it's notorious spanish is not his first language there are dozens of very good latin actors who could've performed as cardinal sebastián petrus antonius general rodríguez was also a bad choice for a latin police officer it was so funny seeing elizondo and petronius in general rodríguez's office they looked like two english or american students in a spanish class making their best effort in order to pronounce spanish unsuccessfully of course castulo guerra was better in his spanish a peruvian officer who announced cardinal sebastián spoke a quite funny spanish too there are very good peruvian actors like augusto alvarez calderón and christian meier just to mention two out of many peruvian actors who could've performed with excellence 6 i admit that a fictional movie can let itself a license inventing cities or even countries but please when creating a name be careful when using a foreign language the town portrayed in this movie should've been called vicente and not viciente vicente is a male name and viciente has never been used 7 i disagree one user who says that this movie was filmed on locations in perú not one location is peruvian although the production has used in excess posters showing inca kola the peruvian soda as not few american films this one must have used any latin country after all for american producers or directors a latin place is identical to any other latin place 8 in the first scenes when john matthew settle flies to perú he's supposed to arrive to the only one international airport in perú jorge chávez airport in lima the capital actually believe me it must be any airport in the world but peruvian airport and of course in peruvian airports there are no military or police guards 9 when this john takes a room in a peruvian hotel this one has a fan and obviously has no air conditioner please this doesn't happen in no hotel in perú and other latin countries unless you get a 1 star hotel 10 the rebels who fight against the government are colombians their accent was with no doubt from colombia for casting them the producers should've hired peruvian actors in few words it would've been cheaper filming in perú i could go on with more examples out of this film that led me to give it a 1 awful vote but i fell asleep after about 20 minutes from its beginning but dear producers it's not a tragedy there are many worse movies with not few mistakes just let's remember indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull and indescribable disney's the emperor's new groove the list of bad films could be endless	negative
i have to start by telling you how i came across this movie it was winter time in alaska around the year 1990 a friend of mine from australia was staying with me and my girl friend in a shoe box of an apartment winters in alaska can be a bit brutal and most people stay indoors drink heavily and watch anything that comes on the television i had found this movie outside of a thrift store laying in a snowbank and right away new it was a treasure it is quite possibly the best worst movie ever we spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like fish we watched it so many times in fact that we would sometimes turn the television on its side or upside down for a more full filling effect it is a true gem the laughs will come nonstop and the memories last forever if you see this movie for rent in a video store steal it you won't regret it	positive
i was lucky enough to see this film at a festival last year and had half expected it to get a release the fact that it was shot on a digital camcorder has surely inhibited its success but as i understand it was never the intention of the film maker to make it look like film in the first place it was more about the story the characters and their relationships is that not what films are supposed to be about but it did have a quality in the texture of its visual appearance that suggests may thomas is onto something we should pay attention to for independent film makers and producers alike who have a the talent and lacking the money and drive a lot can be learned from watching this film technically it has everything going for it the use of light music etc by far outweigh that of any other digital feature film i have ever seen and therefore it is worthy of much praise the actors performances are believable to a point if not slightly under played i felt there was much more in there more depth in particular from the male lead john paul clarke but one thing that really does bother me as a film maker myself is the film being in black and white a need to cover up a multitude of sins than if it was colour do we have more to learn in the progression of digital technology or is this the future of wonderful affordable film making	positive
have you ever watched a film when after it's conclusion your left pondering what in the world it was all about well say hello to scream baby scream it's not that the story's complex or anything like that it's just that it plays out in three completely different modes 1 a fun 60s drug movie 2 a much overplayed soap opera and 3 a horror flick with very little to scream about much to my surprise i've found out that it was written by one of my all time favorites larry cohen well i guess even the best have to learn through trial and error playing out much like something from h g lewis only with lesser fx this bad film does have it's perks for most of it's short running time there's a pretty cool jazz score to be heard and there are a couple of memorable scenes one of those being where a group of kids decide to experiment with acid and take a nice long motor bike ride to the zoo the camera tricks the director uses to indicate their hallucinatory state is just plain retarded but amusing trust me when i tell you there's no need to run out of the house to catch this one	negative
i basically found eden's curve to be a very poorly constructed that made it difficult to watch however there is something i must say about how the director captured something about the atmosphere of the early 70's in the choice of settings and clothing the back to the earth philosophy and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs that was not dramatically decadent as portrayed in many later versions of the 70's was right on as was the don't ask don't tell pseudo liberalism of the fraternity made up of east coast intellectuals except that i would have thought this was more likely of a new england school rather than one in virginia where i imagine the good ole boy mentality still dominated even elitist schools like this one another thing i appreciated and could relate to is that this was a time when homosexuality was not linked so much to leathermen or drag queens and i appreciated some homosexual roles not related to these terribly overused images i felt it was very unfortunate that gay culture took on certain standard forms in the 80's out of castro and christopher streets and these defined the movement and left out huge numbers of gay men that were more subdued in their lifestyles i appreciated the film mainly as a way of remembering a more natural way we were about our sexuality and personal relationships without the scene	negative
i thought this would be funny i did i don't know what happened but i think a lot of the problem unfortunately falls with the casting i don't know who this kid is he could be a very nice person but he wasn't right for this movie and the supporting cast was great which only makes it more obvious for example there would be a scene with him and his love interest and your mind just starts to wander off but then keith david starts speaking or leslie nielsen or marion ross and it's like someone turned a light on and suddenly you can pay attention again and you think it might not be that bad but when they get back to the main characters the lights go out again the spoofing material available in the superhero genre is plentiful so the fact that most of the jokes were basically a fart makes you wonder who wrote this thing i mean it had a couple of funny bits as i do remember laughing a couple of times but right now i don't remember why and it was only a few days ago really i'm giving it a take it or leave it rating but i think most people should just leave it	negative
i woke up and it was a beautiful day the sun was shining the birds were singing and i fancied getting a movie something new a horror movie perhaps like many other reviewers i came across what can only be described as a piece of poopy in a gold wrapper the front cover is great and the comment on the back is mesmerising 'it will scare the crop out of you' oh how i chuckle looking back at such naivety and ignorance one of the many things scarier than this movie is the acting skills of these 'actors' i think no i did actually cheer when they got slashed up by these 'scarecrows' who were wearing some classic fancy dress costumes i used to drive quite quickly past cornfields as i found them to be pretty scary at night but having seen this movie i nearly wet myself through laughing so much just at the sight i have seen scarier omelette's quite honestly not mine though i'm a dab hand at cooking omelette's and if anyone associates this movie with my omelette's let's just say that i would create a situation in which they would be forced to watch this movie 3 times in a row if anyone has any good corn crop not pop movies they can recommend feel free to inform me it's a great comedy if nothing else ok it is nothing else enjoy but a little advice before pressing the play button on your dvd player throw it out of the window	negative

it sounds as if it should be a biography of claude monet but it's actually a highly focused story of relationships between three adolescent girls on a french synchronized swimming team there are no parents or teachers to speak of no school and boys are represented by one peripheral figure the hunky francois who enters the story determined from time to time and always leaves confused pauline aquart is the youngest of the three only aspiring to join the team she so much admires she's kind of odd looking she's not yet out of her adolescent growth spurt and has long bony limbs big feet and no derriere to speak of she's prognathous and sports these plump pursed lips after a while her appearance grows on you and from certain angles she can come to appear enthralling adele haenel is older more well more developed physically what a glamorous figure she cuts in her swim suit sauntering around teasing the boys swishing her long blond hair but she's not what she seems or is she i couldn't quite figure it out the french are long on paradoxes and short on consistency no wonder francois is always sniffing after her there's not so much ambiguity in louse blachere's character she's on the team too but she's dumpy and plain and sensitive about it and has an intense crush on francois blachere is a good actress and adds to the ungainliness of the character through her performance the movie deals with the relationships between these three meaning intrigues deceptions hidden feelings and all the rest of what we associate with young girls who spend much time with one another this is of course a tricky topic it becomes trickier during the gradual development of a homoerotic relationship between pauline and adele not that you should expect this to be a soft porn movie the only nudity we see is considerably less than a turn on and what little sex there is under the covers sometimes literally i don't think i want to get into the plot or into its analysis too much partly because it's suggestive rather than expressed through action partly because it's complex and partly because i'm not sure i got it all let me give an example okay adele is the girl the others envy she's also quite distant and self satisfied on top of that she is apparently schtupping every boy and man in sight if they can be of any use to her at all from the handsome but dumb francois to the bus driver she wants a favor from she brags unashamedly about her expertise in fellatio when pauline approaches her about joining the swim team adele uses her as a lookout during assignations with the guys a superior and self indulgent narcissist you know but then the soi disant slut takes the skinny pauline under her wing and reveals to pauline that she's still a virgin really yes really pauline begins to draw closer to adele and adele finally confesses that she'd like to rid herself of her hymen and she would like pauline to do it for her pauline now drawn sexually to adele performs the task with subdued relish now adele would really like to get it on with a man preferably older and experienced so she takes pauline to a boite where she dances seductively with some guy until she follows pauline to the powder room the two girls stand there staring at one another neither having overtly expressed a sexually tinged interest in the other but adele stands so close that pauline slowly loosens her own reins reaches up and kisses adele on the lips adele steps back smiling and says there now that wasn't so bad was it and then walks back into the club that's a pretty close description of whatever is going on between pauline and adele but what the hell is going on initially adele treats pauline like an irrelevant child later like a close friend finally like a potential lover and the minute pauline responds adele walks off satisfied is she using pauline the way she seems to be using men does it satisfy adele to know that she now has another person in involuntary servitude i don't know i've slighted louise blachere as the third member of the trio the plain and overripe wallflower whose expression always suggests dumbfoundedness but who at least is thoroughly heterosexual and the first of the three to rid herself of that noisome virginity but i've only skipped her for considerations of space should you see it by all means just compare it to the typical american movie about high school kids for men some of whom have never penetrated the female mystique this may give you some idea of what it looks like in medium shot	positive
the folks at aardman have done a cool cute and wild adaptation of their short films of wallace and gromit to feature length as the man and his dog inventors who seem to have more of the intelligence or practicality for the latter in this case they've invented a machine that can capture all of the bunnies that are eating up the crops all over a quiet english village in particular for mrs tottington or 'totty' for those who are 'intimate' much to the chagrin of victor quartermaine who just wants to kill all the rabbits with his trust rifle wallace and gromit seem to have success with their machine but wallace has a mix up a machine he's made to make more food suddenly criss crosses himself with a rabbit the curse is on a lot of this is about as much light hearted fun that a kid's movie could ask for but it also tips its hat to the oldest tradition in classic cartoon slapstick looney tunes which in turn is indebted to much silent comedy and vaudeville granted the aardman guys nick park and steve box have a bunch more gimmicks and tricks and ingenuity with their material it's never less than amazing to see how they put the stop motion to use even when a joke or a gag might be a little on the funny ho ho not funny ha ha side a tired criticism but i'll say it curse of the were rabbit works so well on all fronts for the audience in its warped story and sudden dips into exposition the golden bullet story is a doozy park and box and company never lose sight of glee in the material it's fuzzy and warm hearted and completely off the wall for the kids even the very youngest will love the adventures and strange gadgets such as the truck wallace and gromit drive around in and for adults there's little barbs of funky absurdist tones in the midst of a classic english farce only and i'm probably a minority opinion here when compared to chicken run it's almost a little slight a work there's less any plot than there is a series of running gags and of course lots of puns involving bunnies and monsters and carnivals and cheese and horrible men with egos in their guns like the fiennes voiced quartermaine but when it strikes best it's one of the most entertaining films of 2005 it gives me a big goofy smile anytime it's on tv	positive
this cool marvel superhero game pays proper tribute by staying true to the comics of all the marvel superhero games that have been so lame with weak graphics and gameplay spiderman improves in both departments it also features the voice of stan lee the creator of spiderman comics as you'd expect spiderman does whatever a spider can he does more than spin webs in fact he uses them as weapons and shields when he's not using web in combat he punches and kicks as well spidey has his hands full as he battles venom rhino mysterio scorpion and dr octopus to name a few look for captain america in a cameo most of the levels are challenging but some of them require patience to beat the only complaint about this game is that it's so short and can be completed in less than three hours if you're a real marvel superhero fan this game is for you but don't expect long gameplay better luck in spiderman 2 my evaluation 9 out of 10	positive
a tough sell british playwright ronald harwood adapts his autobiographical stage drama into loud bellowing film about wwii shakespearean theatrical troupe saddled with an aged blustery brilliant but unreliable star at the end of his tether the actor's effete assistant works diligently to get his master coiffed and costumed for a production of king lear during an air raid yet both men are losing their grip on their unraveling situation based on the waning years of actor donald wolfit whose dresser was ronald harwood this acclaimed production would seem to be a welcome haven for scenery chewing thespians unfortunately albert finney at this point in his career not at all elderly seems too robust and quick thinking to play the actor finney and oscar nominated director peter yates cannot modulate sir's moods and bouts of coherency in a way that makes sense to us so that in one scene he's stopping a train with the commanding echo of his voice and in the next he's curiously falling apart with such a wreck of a human being in the midst of failing health and aptitude one would assume a dedicated assistant would go to great lengths to protect his boss and his future yet servant tom courtenay prods and badgers and goads finney to carry on rather than rest courtenay who played this part on stage and was nominated for an oscar alongside finney for best actor is far more attuned to his role and eventually his bleating commands and confusion achieve the only real feeling in the film these two thankfully do not peck at each other's heads and scenarist harwood is careful not to fall into a love hate pattern which could possibly be perceived in the film's first act but without a juxtaposition of servant vs celebrity there's nothing much to behold in this portrait except for the deterioration of narcissism the hint at what once was 1 2 from	negative
i absolutely loved this movie i bought it as soon as i could find a copy of it this movie had so much emotion and felt so real i could really sympathize with the characters every time i watch it the ending makes me cry i can really identify with busy phillip's character and how i would feel if the same thing had happened to me i think that all high schools should show this movie maybe it will keep people from wanting to do the same thing i recommend this movie to everybody and anybody especially those who have been affected by any school shooting it truly is one of the greatest movies of all time	positive
this movie rips off of every mobster gangster film ever made mp da last don has a reference to every movie the acting was by far the worst i have every seen who the hell is john mario anyway his acting was by far the worst i have ever seen he makes bad actors look good as far as master p goes he's selling out quicker than an n sync concert i really wish i was there to tell the whole production company what the hell were you thinking when penning the script obviously these people are so fixated on the gangster image that they decided to make a movie and live out their gangster lives for real in their minds one thing i do know is that there wasn't anyone who wanted to distribute this film so it seems and how predictable that the guys at no limit had to start no limit films i've said enough this movie is terrible and it does not deserve to be called a movie	negative
altioklar's populist approach manifests itself in all his titles from the worst to the best he doesn't care or has no clue about art all he cares is to make people think they've got a kick in the groin by watching his movies the problem is the effort is way too evident and as events unfold with all the senseless exaggeration kneaded into them the effort fails badly on this turkish movie who knows where the original or originals were made since it felt extremely hollywoodish to me altioklar is trying to be some sort of tarantino mr tarantino if you're reading this please watch the movie for the best comedy of your life he doesn't use subtle moves to do that all he does is to use extreme stuff and it gets unbearably absurd and laughable levent üzümcü as the forensic guy with the cow licked hair is just hilarious i'm hoping to meet him in person and ask how he felt about this movie himself because i really found the role insulting for him demet evgar groping her genitalia was also uncalled for and did nothing other than making everything look fake another specifically idiotic aspect of this movie was the 100 faulty pace setting when things need to be taken slowly scenes flow abruptly and at other times it makes you sleepy to watch the slow ridicule going on if altioklar is so deeply in love with lame hollywood superficiality he should use michael sixarrows as his name instead even such a move wouldn't be half as ludicrous as what he has done on this movie he should first learn not to imitate directors whose levels he'll never approach then realize he's not in hollywood and then take private lessons from zeki demirkubuz or reha erdem on how to lay the flow of ideas out in the plot this useless movie couldn't be saved even by those but perhaps he can make watchable movies in the future by taking these steps by the way i've seen some infamous failures such as propaganda and otostop and i still can't divert from saying this one was the worst turkish movie ever	negative
in a future society the military component does not have to recruit rather their candidates are chosen at birth culled from nurseries and designated to spend their entire lives in the service of the government they are given over to the war machine body and soul for no reason other than to protect and serve they have no personal identity other than a name and rank and no autonomy whatsoever this is the fate of those whose destiny is predetermined for them in soldier ' directed by paul anderson and starring kurt russell the scenario is hard and bleak as the movie begins by depicting the training of the soldiers during advancing periods of time from preadolescence to adulthood russell is sergeant todd the best of the best and we glimpse his career as he discharges his duties in an exemplary manner in campaign after campaign he is what he was born to be a soldier but even the best cannot go on forever and the day arrives when todd and his peers are no longer the elite a new generation of soldiers has been created products of advanced genetics and technology and todd's generation is suddenly obsolete what follows is the story of a man who must fight for his life while struggling to discover his own sense of humanity and individuality traits new to a soldier who has known only two things his entire life fear and discipline russell gives a commanding performance as todd the soldier who above all else must obey orders without question while suppressing all emotion and individual thoughts he has few lines in this movie but russell speaks volumes with his eyes this role demonstrates that he is in fact one of the under appreciated actors of our times that he can disappear so entirely into the character of todd is a credit to his ability and with this part he has created someone quite different from any he's done before and he's given todd a depth and credibility that someone of lesser talent could easily have rendered as nothing more than a pretentious and superficial stereotype notable performances are also turned in here by connie nielsen sandra and jason isaacs colonel mekum rounding out the supporting cast are jason scott lee memorable as caine 607 one of the new generation of soldiers sean pertwee mace gary busey captain church michael chiklis jimmy pig and mark bringleson rubrick anderson has delivered an action film with a message a cautionary tale that transcends the genre of science fiction soldier' reminds us of the importance of keeping the humanity of our lives intact it's an entertaining way of making us consider the alternatives like a bleak future and a world in which good movies just wouldn't make a whole lot of difference much like 1984 ' and mad max ' this movie which is ultimately uplifting is going to make you take pause and think about the kind of universe in which we all must live together and share i rate this one 7 10	positive
this is without a doubt one of the most accomplished debut films for any director the movie is only 90 minutes long but manages to say just about everything about life and death not much action and dialogue is minimal but the movie flows perfectly and demands your attention due to the wonderfully natural feel of everything going on the performances by the leads are perfection and even some supporting characters get strong emotional scenes the movie will be somewhat lost on today's modern audience but this is one that everyone ought to see refreshingly unsentimental and honest this is on par with ozu's works scratch my title this one is perfect	positive
i am sick and tired of all these little weenies going on about how this movie rocked it is pure cg over acted crap don't send an assassin it's much more sensible to smuggle hundreds of brightly colored aggressive venomous snakes on a plane the only reason people like this movie because they feel they have to it is not so bad it's good it's so bad i'd rather be poked in the eye with a sharp stick then be subjected to this again i honestly thought was going to be a comedy like airplane a spoof was i wrong it's that whole it sucks get it or samuel a jackson yells snakes on the plane thing well i'm sorry i don't get it it looks like a bunch of wimps gave the movie industry more money to make more movies like triple x and die hard if you what spend money to watch a movie in the company of the same people who bought william hung's cd still live in their mommies basement and stink of plastic chair sweat from days on the computer playing online games and looking at porn then rush to the theater and ask for one since i doubt you have a girlfriend ticket for snakes on a stupid butt plane to hell with movies like full metal jacket pulp fiction true romance 12 monkeys clerks etc there's no irony in watching good movies the true decline of the western civilization calling this a cult film is an insult to true cult classics like repo man or even orgazmo i've said enough here	negative
just watched it on sky tv missed the first half an hour i did wonder if it was a true story so watched it to the end there was no brief at the end to say what happened to everyone it did remind me of speed but at the end of the day i don't suppose it was released at the cinema as we did see the following error the goof that we saw was that they remove the bonnet hood and then later on there are two shots of the car with the police car in front trying to slow it down when the bonnet is back on it did have me on the edge of my seat especially when i thought the baby was going to hit the bridge and of course when the bridge wasn't going to be lowered and then it was i'm afraid i did burst into tears so it wasn't that bad	positive
at first i didn't like the movie cause of it being a nazi swastika drama but after buying it and seeing it it wasn't that bad i heard so many complaints about the numbers being short and ilse werner not singing now i understand the radio show was a super propaganda radio program ilse johanne and zara plus rudy shruki and band like kurt widman and his orchestra and fud cantics ex cetera never appeared in the radio show cause the singers and the bands were of the pop jazz and swing categories the club foot had that regulated that for touring occupied areas for the soldiers to short wave radios for the soldiers also night clubs and hotels in berlin and hamburg and record sales only this is why ilse wasn't allowed to sing in this picture this would be made up by medium budget musical were making music 1942 in which she would demonstrate her whistling but this is an excellent example propaganda inge and her aunt eichhorn played by ida wust goes to the 1936 olympics the aunt forgets her tickets so inge has to wait till her aunt comes back with the tickets she meets carle radditz who plays herbert who has an extra ticket she goes with him and it's love at first sight they plan to marry but the spanish war get in the way so he has to go on an assignment against the right side carl raddatz as so many people complained about him was really handsome and not plain when he did opfergang and they put a mustache on him plus his own suntan that made him plain looking you see the nazi soldiers acting normal like a scene in which a ex butcher and his troops are in france and they steal pigs from a farm and they are about to make lunch until their leader suggest to save the pigs this reflect adolphs animal rights extremism the character was a butcher now soldier this was a subtle put down against meat eating late on in world war 11 herbert is flying in a german airplane we shoot one of the pilots so herbert takes over we shoot his plane they crash unfortunately for us they survive another seen the nazis soldiers go in a bomb catholic church now it's putting the catholics down and hubert's best friend helmet played by joachim brennecke starts to play the organ beethtoven more bombs come in from us the church is bomb more the soldier continues to stay and play the organ he's being told to leave we end up injuring him propaganda message the catholic church organ cause him to become addicted to it it injured him see by this time inge is with her either mother or grandma played hedwig bleibteu the same german grandame actress who played maria holst's aunt in weiner blut well later it comes to the short view of the radio show this was not intended to be a musical revue such as kora terry released that same year were as well as rosen in tirol the music as well as their side of the war was so supposed to be only the back drop it was mainly a war romantic movie it's easy to take a pot shot at those soldier in the movie but in real life many of those soldiers were being forced to fight the nazi cause cause of the job and the monthly pay that they would receive after the war many of them who survive would regret it this is a good swastika classic the only problem is that today you have neo nazi and nazi skin heads who watched the same movies to reflect their hitler worship and their they have disturbing websites who exploit these film classics to raise money for their insanity be careful most of the time it's the direct hate only classics if their scenario looks like they are glorifying it then its a nazi website skip it go to ihf or german wartime films dot com amazon dot dee or german video dot net they are legitimate 01 23 10 mada a mistake it wasn't herbert's friend that got killed at the church it was malte yager's character's friend schartzscop	positive
fat girls is among the worst films within the indie gay genre the premise is promising an average looking gay teen is trapped in a repressive small tx town his only kindred spirits are the other village hs misfits the class 'fat girl' a naïve immigrant from cuba and the sensitive drama teacher so far interesting in theory this plot line creates a decent setup for an appealing coming of age story with a built in audience the thousands of gay men who grew up in small towns across america and experienced this adolescent anxiety first hand peppered with a dose of self deprecating humor unfortunately rather than a nuanced dramedy ash christian approaches his autobiographical subject matter with a poorly executed attempt at irony and dark humor the result is a cast of unlikeable derivative two dimensional characters which the viewer cannot but help feel indifferent toward sabrina fink is a quasi goth bitter navel gazer she is such a prickly unsympathetic person there is little doubt as to the reason for her friendless condition the chemistry between her and rodney christian registers zero this may have been bad casting but is more likely due to a screenplay which is simply unsalvageable consequently one is left wondering when there is such a non existent bond what could possibly warrant their near constant companionship throughout the story sabrina's newfound boyfriend rudy de jesus and rodney's mother judy theaker are among the most exaggerated of the clichéd stock characters ripped off from dozens of other films rudy is the horny undersexed immigrant nerd lifted directly from every raunchy adolescent comedy ever made within the realm of tv or film judy is the born again obsessed with jesus talk and big hair just when you thought the tammy faye thing had been done to death christian inserts a scene where judy's mascara is running with her tears is there anyone in the civilized world that can possibly think this tired old stereotype gag is still funny after seeing it ad nauseum for 20 years in addition to the failed attempts at sardonic humor there are many puzzling story inconsistencies rodney considers himself a fat ugly loser however he simultaneously manages to participate in casual and regular impromptu trysts with the ubiquitous school jock hunk ted miller although these liaisons are devoid of emotional fulfillment most gay teens filled with raging testosterone just like their hetero brethren would find this to be a rather enviable arrangement given the more common alternative of involuntary celibacy rodney finds an object for his affection in bobby bruening an exotic transplant from england against all believable odds the lad not only happens to land in this tiny tx hamlet but is conveniently openly gay to boot like sabrina bobby is an icy angry smart aleck and the viewer is left head scratching as to his magnetic appeal much to his delight rodney is invited by his new crush to the town gay bar where bobby claims to be the dj upon arrival the boyfriend to be promptly leaves rodney solo and heads off to another area of the bar for a quick encounter with a rather handsome young man this is yet one more of the ridiculously inexplicable plot elements since rodney's feeling as an outcast are supposedly derived largely from his lonely existence in a parochial town as tiny as the town is they have openly gay students at the high school a secretly bisexual football captain lesbian moms a gay teacher and it has a gay bar downtown patronized by attractive men no less apparently the place is not so backwater after all ten years earlier todd stephens' edge of seventeen covered nearly the same material with a much more creative honest touching and humorous film	negative
life pod is one of those movies that you just watch and try not to analyze too hard the acting is rather amateurish at best the special effects are obviously low budget but not too bad the story line is rather stock but with an interesting twist computer run amok but not exactly a computer and the running amok is very understandable when the truth is revealed still the movie has its moments and is quite watchable for me at least part of the allure of this movie is the prominent role of kristine debell she may not be the greatest actress in the world but having been a former playmate of the month she is cute enough in all life pod is much like other low budget sci fi movies of the 1980s and somewhat predictable the white star lines bit is cute if completely inaccurate the last of the white star lines company stock was purchased by the cunard lines 1947 and the last ship to sail under the white star colors was the britannic not the sister of titanic which was sold for scrap in 1960	positive
i saw this movie as a kid on creature feature when i lived in new york it was a pretty creepy movie though not as good as horror hotel i just bought this movie on dvd and it is different from what i remember because in the dvd that i bought there are several scenes where the actors speak in french and or italian and no subtitles are provided then the other actors respond in english to what was being said kind of weird also on the dvd box the names of some of the actors are spelled differently than on imdb aside from that this movie is different in that the character of elsie takes her clothes off and provides a nude shot in one scene and in another scene julia tries to force elizabeth barbara steele to make out with her by pushing her down on the bed and kissing her while steele resists that scene existed in the tv version but it was very edited i wonder if there is any extra footage that could be incorporated into a remastered ultra edition it seems sad that some of these old low budget classics have been spliced to bits and sold in all kinds of edited versions where are the master tapes and all the unused footage aside from the first boring twenty minutes before allen is delivered to the castle the rest of the movie is pretty good there aren't too many special effects but herbert's face after julia clubs him is a good one the creepy atmosphere and the strange exotic and seductive look of barbara steele make the movie a lot better than it should be i can honestly say that if barbara steele had not been in this film it would be a big zero she makes the movie a ten	positive
best years of our lives perfectly captures the era of my youth and the feelings of that time the cast was uniformly wonderful this was possibly dana andrews best role of his career and he should also have been nominated for an academy award there are so many wonderful scenes in this movie it is almost impossible to list them all the cinematography is among the best of any film this movie is a time capsule of what is was like in the 1940's a must see movie for any true movie fan some critics have said this movie has aged i disagree the theme of human desires is timeless and the obstacles faced by veterans returning from war will always be with us this is just a great movie one that can be watched over and over again	positive
recently shown on cable tv the movie opens with a disclaimer distancing itself from any co operation of real life persons that in itself is an eye catcher yet the script and acting from the main characters is superb and i found myself engrossed throughout due in no small way to the crisp thoughtful and interesting dialogue the film is about a meeting on one day between two real life musical legends who formerly composed together then seperated the film captures the essence of their lives and philosophies in a story which proffers an explanation for their initial split what is so impressive is that the actors give such seemingly realistic portrayals of the characters they play faults and all that this viewer at least was left believing i was witnessing a true event in almost every detail the great skill of this play is that with astute writing and fine acting a movie basically about two of us talking can make an excellent picture worthy of at least an 8 out of 10	positive

elephant walk was a thoroughly dull film and i really was quite happy when finally a herd of elephants stormed through the mansion and ended this film considering the money and cast you'd sure expect the film to be a lot better though i also question the odd casting of dana andrews as a man who is in love with elizabeth taylor it's not just the age difference but i just can't see the pair as a couple perhaps some of this may be the fault of substituting miss taylor for vivian leigh at the last minute due to miss leigh's deteriorating mental condition though i also have a hard time visualizing andrews and leigh as well in addition for an english woman miss taylor doesn't even seem to try using an accent the film begins with peter finch and taylor meeting and marrying in england their plan is to return to finch's tea plantation in ceylon sri lanka and at first it seems like a good life however there are no women to talk with and the household staff seem to resent her on top of that once back home finch behaves like a boorish jerk and taylor is miserable neighbor andrews can see this and he declares his undying passion for her however taylor isn't yet ready to abandon her marriage but through the course of the film finch treats liz more and more like an object and finally she is ready to leave when out of the blue cholera strikes the plantation so it's up to andrews finch and taylor to work together to save the day though by this point i really didn't care as there is absolutely no chemistry between the characters the dialog is pretty dull and you can't understand why taylor didn't leave her weasel husband within days of arriving in this inhospitable hell the film isn't particularly engaging or convincing and despite a decent budget by paramount the film is a sluggish mess i particularly was surprised that although the film appeared to be filmed on location many scenes were clearly filmed in a studio with a rear projected and grainy shot that wasn't integrated well in one scene for instance taylor finch and the lot are sitting on the veranda and the grass is bright green then when the picture cuts to people dancing right in front of them the grass is brown it's clear they really are not in ceylon in this scene or the scene with the giant reclining buddha my advice is to skip this one or at least keep a pot of coffee nearby to keep you awake despite its budget it's just not a very good or inspired film by the way could miss taylor have been pregnant during part of this film in some scenes particularly at the beginning she's wearing billowy clothes has a double chin and looks puffy this isn't a criticism after all women do get pregnant but if you look carefully you'll see what i mean also by the way the basic plot in many ways is similar to giant a great taylor film indeed it's amazing how casting and decent direction can do so much	negative
not a balanced point of view the director shouldn't express her opinion as truth the movie has some criticism of fujimori but it always gives him and his family the last words so few critics of fujimori were provided that it seems the only reason they were included was to be able to say the movie provides both views but that is not the case the movie barely shows one of the massacres that fujimori is accused of and it gives him credit for the masterminding the murdering of the mrta insurgents that took the japanese embassy it is well documented that the cia did the planning there is even pictures of a well known cia strategist on the site published by caretas magazine and other newspapers the fact that such well known information was not used by the director gives us a few possible conclusions the director is pro fujimori and purposely and falsely chooses to give the credit to him the director does not want viewers to note that the cia and fujimori worked together or it was just out of ignorance since the director is not peruvian and was not present in peru at the time the events occurred the explanation provided by other commentators that fujimori is still fairly popular in peru does not excuse the lack of accuracy and balanced explanations also the statistics provided in the movie for the actual support of fujimori were the highest i have ever heard of most statistics by major poll agencies are much lower another point to mention is that the intelligence that was key in the capture of the leader of sendero and discover the secret network was done by a police force led by ketin vidal and he had complete autonomy from fujimori and montesinos the first government of fujimori did experience an improvement in overall economic trends gdp but this improvement was financed by the privatization of several national industries with contracts that were not beneficial for the country in the long term also the gap between rich an poor continued to increase during fujimori's regime in his second term the economy was suffering and there was nothing else to privatize and by the end of fujimori's second term the economy was about to collapse in terms of investments in infrastructure of fujimori's regime they fallow the paternalistic pattern they were created to raise support for fujimori but were not meant to last long these structures needed continued maintenance but fujimori did not provide political power for the civilians in order to demand further investment in fact fujimori's regime was able to destroy most forms of political organizing such as unions and grass roots groups and the increase in informal unorganized labor was immense finally the director chose to spend most of the movie talking to fujimori instead of citing the cases of massive corruption in favour of fujimori the media business owners the military etc that were so wide spread it was impossible that fujimori was not aware of it	negative
while i am a long time shatner fan since we used to watch trek re runs over the dinner hour in the early '70s i cannot think of any possible reason why he wanted to do this film whether for personal development or business reasons did he lose a bet as a movie fan i like to appreciate the bad films along with the great ones but shoot or be shot doesn't have any flair or funny bits unintentional or not while unrated there were no objectionable scenes blink or you'll miss it nudity cartoonish gunfire violence with the endless bullet gunfights so one is led to believe that the producers merely wanted to save the fee required to get the mpaa to rate it this will make its way to cable with barely 10 seconds edited out of the eight people that were in the theatre with us four of them left mid way muttering statements like this is stupid shatner plays an escaped mental patient who has been denied release because he views himself as a screenwriter the examination board stamps his request insane he runs into a group of z grade moviemakers who shoot on video because its 80 cheaper than film and decides to force them to shoot his script at gunpoint there are a few minor subplots that develop some of the secondary characters but for the most part that is the whole movie if you want to spend 90 minutes on a shatner art film see free enterprise instead it is a much better film	negative
this was a well written tale of the making of the batman sitcom and actually reunites our heroes on a great quest as well as offers their tv shows history unlike the brady's and partridge family documentary movies we not only get a look into the past and present lives of adam and burt but also get to see them back in action filled with kapow's and catwomen and the riddler s batman is back ina well told tale that not only gives us a satisfactory closing to the batman series but fills the modern fan in on all the hollywood tales that about them that haven't been heard in 35 years kudos	positive
white fire was recommended to me by a guy who owns it on two separate dvd releases and on vhs he claimed it's one of the funniest and coolest low budget actioners ever made i generally don't watch movies knowing that they're going to be bad but i made an exception for this one and i was very glad that i did it's filled to the brim with action much of it surprisingly graphically gory sleaze isolated to nudity with a key female character but there's so much of it in one scene that it becomes hilarious and outrageously awkward dialogue all of which adds to the laughter inducing tone of the film ginty the unusual looking star of the exterminator and countless other low budget action turds is amusing in the lead giving the best performance he could muster williamson is better than usual clearly hamming it up with unparalleled glee and he doesn't come in until midway through the rest of the cast is also fun to watch particularly the villains one of whom is a sadistic sexpot who speaks with an accent that appears to be a mish mash of spanish and italian she's priceless again i can't stress enough how gory it was it's not so bloody that it's nauseating but it's uncommonly violent in parts with some meaty squibs going off in the shootouts and it has a grueling torture sequence that no man will soon forget also when ginty is being swarmed by a pack of bad guys he conveniently gets a hold of a chainsaw and the splatter moments that follow will have any and all action fans cheering and spilling their beers don't miss white fire it's a rollicking if mind numbingly stupid action classic	positive
this film which is based on a true story comes from first time director and long time actor denzel washington denzel washington has given us some of the best performances of the last decade as a black soldier in the civil war in glory and a lawyer in the acclaimed philadelphia and of course he made special notoriety last year when he won the academy award for best actor in training day in which denzel washington became the first african american to receive the award for best actor i guess denzel wanted a change of pace so he chose to direct antwone fisher in which he also stars fisher is played by derek luke who is new to the silver screen but has made some guest appearances on such television shows as king of queens and he will be appearing in the upcoming film release of biker boyz this is a truly well done film from denzel washington considering it was his first time directing undoubtedly denzel felt some kind of commitment and believed in the real life story of antwone fisher antwone fisher is about a young african american man in the navy who constantly gets into fights and after one particular brawl he is sent to see a navy psychiatrist named jerome davenport played by denzel washington davenport helps antwone to deal with his troubled past and learn to move on with his life by finding his birth mother who had to give him up at birth because she was in prison what makes this film good is the fact that it's not overly melodramatic i was expecting something a little more like good will hunting with a lot of swearing fighting and vulgarity not that i didn't like good will hunting or the swearing fighting and vulgarity of the film were out of place quite the contrary however antwone fisher is a true story and i don't think that washington wanted to sensationalize the story for dramatic affect in the film don't get me wrong there are moments when we see antwone fighting carrying on and having moments when it seems like the world is closing in on him after all in his first session with his psychiatrist the character played by washington devenport asks fisher where he was born and fisher's response is from under a rock ' an obvious jab at the pressures waning on antwone fisher's soul but i had to appreciate the fact that this film wasn't sensationalized for dramatic affect i think it shows real character on the part of denzel washington to deliver a more realistic story and to avoid the typical clichés that are common in hollywood films even those based on true stories one other point that i would like to bring up about antwone fisher is the acting over all performances were good in the film but not great at times i think it was a bit obvious that the main characters were actors but overall to complain about performances in this film would be ludicrous one actress that i would like to point out in this film is viola davis she plays antwone's mother but she says barely two sentences in the movie at all but not so much because she appears at the end of the film but more because she in shock that her long lost son antwone has found her what i would like to point out about her as an actress in the lack of use of her she in basically a character actress and i haven't seen her play any really elaborate roles she made appearances in traffic out of sight kate leopold and two recent films far from heaven and solaris in steven soderberg's remake of solaris she played a scientist on a doomed space craft orbiting a planet in that film she is confronted by george clooney's character and she drawn to tears by what clooney tells her in a particular scene when i first saw solaris i remember seeing her tear up in the scene and thinking wow this woman can act it was as if you could feel the character's grief in that brief shot of her face she gave so much expression and i honestly felt very sorry for her character's sadness and trouble in the film i think she has definite potential as an actress and should be used more often perhaps in leading roles rather than just as a character driven actress nonetheless antwone fisher is a very good movie denzel washington as always pulls off a great performance and he gives us a great directorial debut also derek luke is a very talented actor i think that antwone fisher will bring his immense critical fame for his portrayal of the troubled man but i think that his public popularity will increase with the release of biker boyz which also stars lawrence fishburn antwone fisher is based on the book finding fish a memoir ' by antwone quenton fisher	positive
i went straight to the big screen to view this kicker this is the only flick that i know of that tarsem singh has directed but boy was it intense this movie was a total mind stimulant and one of the best special effects flick of this kind the characters were vibrant and and nothing short of beings created in your own mind or nightmare this movie is scary and interesting and totally bombs the senses with fear and exhilaration this movie compares to no other i have seen except for the level of being beautifully odd in that respect it is a fairly large step above a clockwork orange ' definitely see this movie on the big screen and don't wait for it to come out on tape it won't be half as good on tape this movie is not for the easily freaked out it will mess with your mind and leave you with images that take a while to forget but for those who like to be freaked out enjoy	positive
penelope spheeris of wayne's world fame made her mark with the documentary the decline of western civilization about the la punk scene in the late '70s and early '80s most of the documentary features interviews with the punks and footage of concerts which often turn violent overall we get to see how the punk movement was a reaction to the hippies whereas the hippies were into being natural the punks wanted to have themselves as altered as possible what with spiked hair and all but also we see how they're really disaffected and sometimes becoming skinheads anyway this is a really great time capsule we're not really sure whether we want to long for that era or feel repulsed by it but this is definitely not a documentary that will leave you neutral truly worth seeing	positive
this movie was exactly what i expected it to be when i first read the casting i probably could have written a more exciting plot it's a pity that they left it to a pack of howler monkeys alberto tomba was surely a good skier but he has to thank god and we too that he does not have to rely on his actor skills to earn his living he can't play he can't talk he can't even move very good on mainland without his skis michelle hunziker is a pretty blonde girl and that's all she obviously wasn't chosen for her astounding competence in dramatic roles but most probably for her nice legs nevertheless i must admit that she could be the tomba's acting teacher because he's even a worse actor than her and that's funny especially considering that she isn't italian i laughed all the time watching this movie i found it so ridiculous and meaningless that it actually made me laugh loud very loud	negative
tempo di uccidere time to kill by guiliano montaldo is a bit of a strange film but it's good in it's own way i won't bother with a summary of the plot most that i've read gives the wrong impression and makes me believe that most people who wrote those didn't really understand the film and you need to understand it to some level even if you cannot describe for yourself what it's actually about this film is strange in a once upon a time in america way only shorter many 'hollywood' stars whatever that may mean have played in lesser known italian productions it's known that many actors who are past their prime or slowly rising to it do this cage was not yet a real star when this was made i'm not a fan of him he's very good in some roles raising arizona bringing out the dead and weak when he plays the hero i don't really know what to think of him in this one but he sure doesn't portray the typical hero main character this film could have done without him but the fact that he starred may be the only reason this one ever made it to dvd the supporting cast is good not one of them looks fake and they act as if they are really there solid support i have seen 3 films by montaldo marco polo sacco vanzetti and this one and i think he is one of the greater directors of this time unfortunately nobody knows him this movie was his last in a long time a break of 19 years i think that this movie might have failed at the office but from the way it is done i think that for montaldo it was a personal project that he really liked the production is great it's always enough the dusty army camps the claustophobic cities and the magnificent landscape all play a great part it all feels very real in some scenes you can almost feel the heat the sound itself is nothing special but the music by ennio morricone is very good it's not a piece that you will whistle when in the shower but it sure works great so this movie looks feels and sounds just right it doesn't serve the lessons learned from it on a golden platter but that may be the biggest difference between hollywood and euro cinema all around it might sound strange to give it an 8 and not recommend it to people but that is what i do if you are looking for action avoid this one if you are looking for a well made apocalypse now in a different time and setting but with a bit of similar journey into a 'state of mind' sorry if this sound corny but i don't know what else to call it you just might enjoy this one a lot	positive
i am profoundly grateful to have seen this movie the acting is astonishing the movie itself is powerful and clear and the issues involved are handled with subtlety and depth this is an important movie it could be profoundly transformative i would pay good money never ever to see it again because it is so good and so complex it is extremely difficult to watch i admit that my taste in movies tends strongly toward light entertainment the visual medium can be so powerful that i tend to avoid it for anything really important those of you with greater fortitude than i have may find it easier to handle but i strongly encourage people to see it at least once preferably with others so you can talk to each other and have someone around to remind you that there's more to the world than the movie	positive
a friend once asked me to read a screenplay of his that had been optioned by a movie studio to say it was one of the most inept and insipid scripts i'd ever read would be a bold understatement yet i never told him this why because in a world where films like while she was out can be green lighted and attract an oscar winning star like kim basinger a screenplay lacking in character content and common sense is no guarantee that it won't sell as so many other reviewers have pointed out while she was out is a dreadfully under written woman in peril film that has abused housewife basinger hunted by four unlikely hoods on christmas eve every gripe is legitimate from the weak dialog and bad acting to the jaw dropping lapses of logic but basinger is such an interesting actress and the premise is not without promise here are a couple of things that struck me 1 i don't care how much we are supposed to think her husband is a jerk the house is a mess with toys since when did it become child abuse to make kids pick up after themselves 2 racially diverse gangs are rare everywhere except hollywood where they are usually the only racially balanced groups on screen 3 sure the film is stupid but so are the countless thrillers i've sat through where the women are portrayed as wailing helpless victims of male sadism stupid or not i found it refreshing to see a woman getting the best of her tormentors 4 i loved the ending 5 though an earlier reviewer coined this phrase i really do think this film should be retitled the red toolbox of doom	negative
i am not a usual commenter on this website but seeing how underrated this movie is i endeavour myself to write some comments and remarks about it i had fun watching this movie perhaps because cat is everything i wish i could be i am not going to post spoilers or reveal plots but there's are things that i really found amazing the way she manipulates people it's just so divine this is a very underrated movie i lack of arguments here i usually go enjoy and then speak little about it when you go to the movies is to have fun and i really enjoyed the 1h53 i stayed in the dark room a must seen over and over again until the delight fades away let's try not be so critical about it thank you for reading	positive
something very strange happens when you talk about global warming science goes out the window and belief and consensus becomes the topic of discussion it's because of that fact that i give a failing mark to al gore's documentary instead of promoting intelligent discussion he kept the debate at the level of belief and consensus of course when you're trying to sell the world into spending trillions of dollars to stop global warming you may thing it's a problem to tell the scientific truth we don't know how much of the current warming was caused by humans maybe none of it maybe some of it or maybe it has over ceded the next ice age and we got really lucky not to have boiled the planet but the fact remains that we don't know so we're asked to believe in the consensus never mind that any scientist that strays from the consensus is ostracized never mind that scientific inquiry is about straying from the consensus einstein didn't believe in the consensus neither did copernicus or galileo so why so much scorn placed on those very researchers who would advance the field by asking the tough questions if global warming is so incontrovertible surely a few people testing that theory can't be so threatening what is going on here that's the movie i was hoping al gore would have made istead he chose to shore up his support with the true believers of the consensus sad really	negative
spoilers this is tenchi this is not tenchi practically everyone is written horribly out of character when it comes to characterization the only bright spot is the friendship between ayeka and ryoko also the villainess is not punished for her actions which amount to mind control rape if a male villain had done to one of the women what haruna does to tenchi then he would have rightfully so painfully bought it at the end of the movie dying horribly and the audience would have cheered but not only does haruna pay no price for her crimes ryoko actually forgives and understands her actions no the real ryoko would have disintegrated her for what haruna had done to her beloved tenchi the audience i saw this with myself included all booed audibly at this scene anime fans avoid this movie tenchi fans avoid this movie even harder	negative
even mst3k couldn't make this painful long and ultimately mind bending drek funny or entertaining while most bad movies in and of themselves are hilariously bad this one is one of those few videos that uses the word bad in its literal sense the element that makes this so painful to watch is not the lack of story but the fact that soooo much background is crammed into the first half hour that it is utterly ridiculous and harder to follow than a highway while driving with no headlights the hero of the film ator is no more than eye candy for this literal energy sucker of a film dressed in a loin cloth and sporting pecs like melons as joel put it he belongs more in a fitness magazine than here i would recommend this only to die hard and i mean die hard followers of cheese if you have an enemy recommend them this film if you make it through this i commend you you should be able to make it through anything	negative
seeing the title of this movie stupid teenagers must die made me believe this was a spoof of some kind i discovered later on the original title was blood and guts both titles are misleading though this is not a spoof neither a serious splatter movie this is something in between failing in both areas a group of teenagers is attending a séance at a spooky house and then the killing starts sounds over familiar doesn't it well this movies adds nothing whatsoever to the endless stream of similar movies and it is badly made because of the lack of light the entire film is grainy now this effect can be highly effective but it isn't in this case the young cast isn't acting too badly but the director has no clue as what to do with actors in numerous scenes the actors are clearly waiting for directions but these are given too late it could also be an editor's mistake of course the characters are unrealistic and the story line just stinks the sound is terrible at times conversations are undecipherable but when talking loudly or screaming the actors are very loud indeed this is not the worst horror movie i have ever seen but it still is a bad one for me a 3 out of 10	negative
i suppose it's nice and trendy to see wonderful things in the absolute emptiness of a film like this with the sometimes pointless excesses of many hollywood films we can relax and enjoy a scene devoid of explosions foul language and corny one liners minimalism has its place and can be very effective when employed properly however this film is not one of those cases take the long scenes with no dialogue and dreary sparse scenery i'm sure that they must hold some great meaning and insight because the implied message in shrouded in bafflement the acting is poor bland and pedestrian and features one of the worst crying scenes in history at the end of the film if you can sit through it to the end the scenery is drab and the ridiculously long ending sequence of the girl walking through the barren park is as pleasurable as having a tooth pulled i would call this anticlimatic but as the film didn't build to any sort of climax whatsoever not even in the erotic scenes it would be untrue i'm sure that there was a script employed during the filming but with the amount of dialogue i think it might have been written on a cocktail napkin basically this film offers nothing to interest or amaze no great story no stunning insights no visual drama no excitement apart from two or three amusing moments this film is a waste of two hours a tragically boring and dreary film	negative
first of all i thought it was naughty of them to say in the credits that the story and screenplay were by preston sturges sturges was one of the better hollywood screenwriters until his talent faded and he retired however it wasn't the preston sturges it was preston sturges jr the story was essentially based on robert louis stevenson's short story the bottle imp a good man comes into possession of an evil object that will grant him any wish but which will ultimately doom him to hell that's fine nobody said screenwriters had to be original the actors are generally pretty competent given the mediocre writing that they had to translate onto the screen my biggest complaint comes with the ending the hero thinks he has discovered a way out of his dilemma but tries to solve the problem in a somewhat different way in an attempt to save an innocent person at first this seems to have worked but true to the code of the modern horror film they feel they have to provide one last dollop of horror at the very end of the film this is a stupid convention the older horror films got along just fine with allowing the hero to win out at the end there is nothing wrong with good triumphing over evil no matter what the current crop of film makers seems to think you can give the audience a good healthy scare and still make them feel happy at the end in fact i think it's preferable	negative
i got this movie from the library and saw it had a lot of actors i like in it john cleese ian holm ralph richardson etc so i got it and watched it i expected cleese to have a large role since he had first billing i was surprised to find out that he had about five minutes of screen time along with everyone else i liked this movie is amazingly pointless the characters are nobodies the plot is non existent and the ending is one of the worst endings i have ever seen there were a few funny parts but that's about it stay away from this movie if you want to prevent going what and huh a lot and if you don't want to waste your time ignore the people who say this is a very funny movie it isn't just stay away from it at all costs please	negative
this movie about two italian brothers who came to germany with their family is just great it isn't an idealistic movie i would say it shows life as it is or was in the 60s and 70s when the main story takes place the characters are very nice but have also some dark sides what makes you believe that these are real persons great movie with great actors to show that life is not funny all the time but that you can find happiness with fire and passion as the main character gigi would say	positive
a friend of mine recommended this movie citing my vocal and inflective similarities with des howl the movie's main character i guess to an extent i can see that and perhaps a bit more i'm not very sure whether or not that's flattering portrayal this is a pretty unique work the only movie to which this might have more than a glancing similarity would be true romance not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue whale music is just so much more well relaxed but instead that they both represent modern love stories in general i'm a big fan of canadian movies about music and musicians for example i highly recommend hard core logo and this film in particular it has an innocent charm des is not always the most likeably guy but there's something about him that draws a sterling sort of empathy	positive
with the current trend of gross out humor this film is the granddaddy of them all while some of the humor is dated every skit will either shock repulse or make you laugh out loud most memorable is the sex games commentary and of course the vd commercial it doesn't always work but pays off when it does i give this a 7	positive
i absolutely love stand up comedy i love to hear the raw thoughts of the stand up on stage as they are appealing to an audience of their peers different life experiences they have had or things they have thought up or seen that they just thought were so ing stupid that they had to share it with someone there used to be stand ups who took on a persona that everyone could relate to rodney dangerfield comes to mind or were just so damn crazy that you couldn't help but laugh with them as they laughed at others richard pryor and then there were the thought provoking comics like george carlin who despite pretending to be a loon was the smartest guy in the room who appealed to people to rethink things they saw when they walked around and realize just how screwed up things were and how easily they could change things now this might seem to not have anything to do with mind of mencia which as i agree with most commentators here is comedy central's horrid solution to the loss of chappelle's show but it does carlos mencia spends half of the show doing stand up bits for his audience sometimes on popular topics most of the time on just racism and racial stereotypes he tries to be all three of the above types of stand ups he makes a stage character an every day mexican named carlos who despite stereotypes is just your run of the mill normal guy he then proceeds to try to laugh at others people he calls racist or just those that disagree with his opinion and then finally he presents skits to the studio audience and the viewer telling them that it will help them see his point of view carlos mencia always says he's showing a point of view that people don't see yet what he is really doing is not only promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and have been joked about to death but he stupidly encourages people to hear them and do the one thing that helps keep them around laugh promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest yet easiest way to get laughs in stand up the best comedians which i fear carlos mencia feels he is in good company with don't have to resort to them they talk universally and ask you to laugh at absurdity rather than with it like mencia encourages as he creates more skits or real life situations that call for racism or the bashing of others with the use of it he tells us rather than asks us to laugh and actually presents these absurdities as truth rather than just extremes of it his show is an insult to the minds of those who watch it mencia doesn't give us comedy and ask us to digest it and take from it what we want something that as much as i hate to compare the two was chappelle's show's finest quality he tells us exactly how we should view it and react to it which according to him is to make a stupid face and say dee dee dee this show is appropriately named it is indeed a show about the mind of mencia it's mencia's mind through and through and as such is nothing more than dumb entertainment the show is tailor made to give life lessons to its core audience 14 24 year olds about how stereotypes are bad but that racial bashing is alright to carlos mencia and therefore should be alright to you	negative
i recall so many things about seeing this movie back during it's original theatrical release the post woodstock afterglow of peace and love along with the pre watergate tension of fear and paranoia it's hard to believe that it's thirty seven years later and i can still remember the thoughts going through my head while watching the film with my best friend like marveling at peter boyle's characterization of the ultimate redneck sure to typecast him the rest of his career oh how wrong and how the counter culture jarred the sensibilities of most of the country to this day my buddy and i still use joe curran's line from my summary above when faced with a dilemma curious how a simple line like that can stay with you for decades it's curious to read comments about the film from others on this board particularly the ones stating that the film has a dated quality and how over the top the characters were still if you were around during that time the picture gives a pretty accurate portrayal of the polar opposites that existed back then pretty much side by side as the events in the story reveal if you really want dated when was the last time you heard the words macy's and gimbel's in the same sentence or a line like joe's come on get with the pepsi generation for historical perspective you have that great nixon poster lingering in one of the background scenes would you buy a used car from this man with minor intricacies like those director john avildsen captures many of the subtle but ever present hints of how life was four decades ago today's viewing was only the second time i've seen the movie and i have to admit i don't remember susan sarandon in one of the lead roles but then again this was her very first picture the scenes of nudity and free love were something actually quite new and bold at the time shocking in fact as film makers began to experiment with their ability to push the envelope of propriety and convention joe took a major leap in that regard particularly since it was a 'mainstream' picture with the passage of time the thing that impresses me the most about peter boyle was how he overcame the stereotype of joe curran to appear in or star in some of my very favorite pieces of work i mean how do you go from joe to that hilarious rendition of 'puttin' on the ritz' in young frankenstein and my absolute favorite episode of 'x files' has boyle as clyde bruckman in both a tender and tragic funny and serious portrayal that turns the tables on scully and mulder more than once and as a career capper frank barone has to be one of the funniest characters in the history of television even repeat episodes in syndication are funny as he whenever the elder barone lets loose with one of his observations he is one actor that this viewer sorely misses already	positive
whenever someone tries to tell me that they think a movie is the worst ever and it's usually some movie that's cool to hate like manos the hands of fate or the avengers i ask them is that movie a comedy about an orphan who is constantly trying to murder adults does anyone utter the line 'i'd rather eat a turd' in that movie this movie is way too infantile and moronic for adults and way too violent and irresponsible for children is there that much money in the beavis and butt head demographic to make a series of movies like this there is a problem child 3 but i haven't seen it i'd rather eat a turd	negative
the real shame of the gathering is not in the bad acting nor is it in the despicably shallow plot the real shame is that it was far worse than the series it begun even though it did have one main attraction takashima i would love to see laurel takashima in a room with susan ivanova even for just five minutes she has that sarcasm that wit that double edged personality that is at once volatile and lovable sadly though the babylon 5 pilot movie has an incredibly dull story involving assassination patricia tallman who never seriously returned to the series until much later fortunately got much better with age as lyta alexander who here is little more than a whiny tiresome telepath i shall leave you with one final thought why is it that delenn looks like some sort of outer space frog man even though she is a woman thank heavens for the way the minbari looked later in the show	negative
titanic is a classic i was really surprised that this movie didn't have a solid ten overall in the imdb user rankings maybe it's just cool to not give titanic credit nowadays but when it was first made it was really something when the movie came out people flocked to the theaters when it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month it was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot like the frozen baby or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd many people died on that ship and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that james cameron stepped up to and let's not forget the amazing romance between jack and rose whether or not their relationship was a figment of someone's imagination it was lovely they barely knew each other but they would die for each other they trusted each other they sure as hell are giving romeo and juliet a run for their money i'll never let go jack titanic is a great film down to it's very core it is a powerful story told through brilliant acting excellent cinematography beautiful music and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers it really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie	positive
this is simply the most astonishing movie you will ever see i thought it was just another documentary but it really is something else it doesn't try to teach you anything it shows you how life works in nature i won't talk about the quality of the pictures because you obviously know from other comments it is unmatched earth is funny tense and sad it can make you laugh it can make you cry sometimes both at the same time this is the first movie that made me cry not because you feel sorry for the animals but because you come to realise how fragile our planet is and what treasure we were blessed with yet we don't appreciate it one bit this movie should be shown obligatory in schools it is the most wonderful film you will ever see so go and see it who knows maybe it is the last time we might see our planet like this 10 10 but i would easily rate it more if it were possible	positive
wow i loved this film it may not have had the funding and advertising that the latest hollywood blockbusters get but it packs twice the emotional punch the tale revolves around this one family from utah and it's the connections between the people in the family that provide the film with its punch the main lead giovanni ribisi plays his part very well at no time does he leave you to believe that he's acting all his feelings it's his brother elias koteas who stole the show for me though when the two were in scenes together they bounded their lines off of each other giving fantastic performances great cast great film	positive
well vivah is quite a good but typical sooraj barjatya's movie it shows different aspects of indian families wedding ceremonies etc the movie is more than good but not extremely good the big plus point of the movie is direction music and shahid and amrita's acting especially the last scene the movie starts with a common factor of indian movie a girl being disliked by her step mother story is the movie is a bit common but it is good good enough to make the movie a blockbuster minus point is common story of bollywood movie overall i would say it is two times must watch movie if you want to see typical indian family values and of course love	positive
this man's navy is as other comments have indicated a rare and well filmed look at navy lighter than air lta activities the lta crews were justly proud that the convoys they shadowed never lost a ship to submarine attack and the filming at the various nas locations give a valuable glimpse at a type of aviation that is long gone however the first half of the movie is all about beery his relationship with his service pals and him meeting the tom drake character and his mother and getting drake's leg fixed only then does the second film start the second film is mostly ltas in action taking on a surfaced sub guys get killed and much damage is caused the look is fairly gritty and realistic i imagine then we shift to southeast asia did the navy have ltas there never mind this part is really wild with a blimp being used to extract some downed aircrew from the jungle and the japs are shooting like mad shades of vietnam except the getaway is oh so leisurely this is a blimp we're talking about in the end a feel good wwii drama about a very unusual part of the war	positive
this show can most accurately be described as tv bubble gum it's chewing it has a good taste to it and it lasts a long time but like bubble gum it can leave a bad taste in your mouth after a few too many chews this show features very simple questions that take the form of simply games like hangman guessing a simple phrase or guessing items on a short list callers are the contestants and anybody can play the questions though are terribly easy there's some techno music pumped into the background that's fashioned into a continuous loop it never seems to get old but it never adds much to the show anyway the hostess however regardless of which one that it is extremely personable pleasant enough to watch and can make some very amusing facial expressions i rather enjoy that british woman but there's nothing to this show it's simplistic and uncompelling although it can be entertaining if absolutely nothing else is on	negative
a 14 year old girl develops her first serious crush on the 17 year old boy that lives near by while simultaneously trying to overcome her feelings of inadequacy in comparison to her older sister that is the simple premise of this beautiful poetic coming of age film from director robert mulligan mulligan is famous for previously directing summer of '42 in 1971 and to kill a mockingbird in 1962 two giants of the coming of age genre here he directs newcomers in the principal roles reese witherspoon in her film debut as the 14 year old girl emily warfield as the older sister jason london as court the 17 year old boy reese witherspoon is astonishingly good in her film debut displaying every emotion that a 14 year old girl feels in experiencing young love and hurt never striking a false note warfield and london are both equally good as well the film accurately depicts each adolescent's thoughts or feelings in regard to love with heartfelt sensitivity never crossing over into maudlin excess even once kudos to the autobiographical screenplay from jenny wingfield this is one of the very few films about young love that is honest and consistent in tone without being emotionally dishonest or sensationalist the music is wonderfully simple accentuating the tone and mood from scene to scene but never becoming intrusive the beautiful cinematography is by famed horror director freddie francis who was in his 70's when this was shot tess harper and sam waterston play the girls' parents with dead aim accuracy for 1957 caring strict and emotionally simple gail strickland is good also as the boy's mother there are feelings to sort out lessons to learn and truths to face in this sweet natured film that packs an emotional wallop to date this is robert mulligan's last film this is one of the very best films of 1991 of 4 stars	positive
i have been an environmentalist for years and was really looking forward to this show i had it set to record all episodes because i thought i could really learn some great new things i probably could if i could get past rachelle i'm sure a lot of this is staged to seem like a reality show and appeal to that class of viewer it doesn't work for someone who's really interested in improving the planet this show should be called nagging with rachelle since ed is such a great font of information maybe a second show that's really serious about the environment would be a good idea dumbing things down is not necessary for some of us i no longer record episodes or watch the show but do let me know if a real green show may be in the works	negative
we all enjoyed the movie it is a very charming family film with many fun cameos it was fun to see austin musicians charlie robison joe ely and robert earl keen in the film as well as turns by famous actors julia roberts and bruce willis emma roberts is especially cute in the film however all the children are good the west texas scenery is great as is the soundtrack full of texas artists the last half seemed a bit far fetched to me however my son was interested throughout the film which is not so often with him something in the storyline was captivating for children having shown calves as a child i really liked the ending that is definitely not the way it really works unless you have heifers	positive
i still can't believe that wes craven was responsible for this piece of crap this movie is worse than deadly friend the plot is stupid the acting is mediocre and the film is deadly dull i don't know why wes craven hates his debut last house on the left an absolute masterpiece of the genre and likes probably this turkey don't get me wrong i really like some of his movies but it was a real torture sitting and watching this	negative
the movie has only one flaw unfortunately this flaw damages all credibility of the piece it starts with the condemnation of the israeli occupation of disputed territories it fails to address the reason israelis are there egypt syria iraq and jordan attacked israel this is why israel occupys their land because those countries lost it in a war they started the film also claims that israel has defied the u n by not complying with resolution 242 problem is 242 was rejected immediately upon it's inception by the palestinians making it void many films are put together well and can really show footage that changes minds but remember when watching anything believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see all participants in this film are known critics of israel and some have made many antisemitic public comments removing any possible credibility to their words all participants are in dire need of a actual history lesson taught objectively not by some palestinian sympathizer	negative
yes this is one of the greats of the black action genre confusing mixture of racist comedy and racist violence at times reaching a disturbing pitch even for a fan of the genre this movie isn't your shaft in the park wonderful bits of rudy ray moore comedy stand up that don't seem funny at least not to a white boy like me but great in context much better than its dissimilar sequel the human tornado	positive
another comment about this film made it sound lousy given talking pictures were so new i think the script and acting were good davis was so young and fresh she had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect yet it is great to see her this way still learning the craft so many clichés came from this film and it seems this film blazed some trails for the next 70 years my vote is see it and remember how young this type of film was keep and open mind and you maybe shocked at how troubled the characters were in this picture for being 1934 and how we view the early part of last century as uptight i love it and hope you make up your own mind about it not influenced by others negative and one note comments	positive
worst movie ever made please see the real movie reviews from the pros on this movie check rotten tomatoes on the web for some good independent reviews on this film the comments made on this site are apparently from folks with some financial interest in this film i find the positive comments very misleading i find it amazing how the negative comments are so bad against this movie and the positive comments sound like an academy awards speech don't waste your hard earned money this film is retarded i can't believe a film like this would ever be made why would hollywood waste their time on such junk this film is an attempt at nothing i ask myself what looser would actually sink their money producing such trash i went to blockbuster and the attendant even told us not to waste our time or money i didn't listen and i did waste my time and cash please don't make the same mistake it really is the worst movie ever made	negative
boogie nights is perhaps one of the greatest examples any would be filmmaker should take a long hard look at sure you could spend loads of quality time reviewing the clasics from hitchcock to scorsese but lets follow suit for the modern generation and study half heartedly where to begin i suppose one could look at the film as simply a story perhaps even docudrama which focuses on the late 1970's porn industry and what an industry it was the other half could focus on the incredible detail one brillant filmmaker can achieve simply by using polyester and ahem rubber but honestly boogie nights brings back the pure no bul shi in your face kind of cinema i haven't experienced since the film greats of the 1970's ironic or stroke of genius the story is full of richly detailed characters all of which you either can relate too love or hate but the impact is clear you are feeling something for them among the characters the two performances which stand out are burt reynolds as director jack horner and mark wahlberg as eddie adams dirk diggler julianne moore is also brillant as is heather graham but if i focus on any one actor it would have to be john c reilly john's performance is a perfect balance of comedic timing and character driven emotion i'm a sucker for the line ever see the movie star wars people say i look like han solo anyway the look of the film is incredible the director of photography and director writer producer have come up with a vibrant colour and flashy style that compares to martin scorsese and stanley kubrick in terms of his perfection of his craft but with creating his own unique look and pushing the edge with the longest single shot i'ver ever seen that being the new year's party sequence the music like in any great film is a character of its own at times it consumes oneself with sorrow or grief but mainly its all about fun dancing and having a good time the spirit of the 1970's ok back to the performances burt reynolds plays the character of jack horner a porn director who feels the burden of what the future of film means to his genre the awful transition from shooting on film to recording on magnetic tape the lose of his art as it were and the changes in mentality to the people he works with walhberg adds the perfect blend of innocense and sexual bravado needed for the character for all those individuals who have seen burton's planet of the apes pay no attention to the performance of wahlberg in that film rent boogie nights and see what a difference a good script can make julianne moore plays the would be mother to all and with that comes the torment and anguish she feels as life imitates art and she loses all those close to her heather graham is the eye candy but later holds her own and steals some of the scenes from even the great mr reynolds himself each character is multidimensional rich with life and performed by actors that seem to be picture perfect for the part the film itself is often funny tragic exciting and provides a uncompromising look into the turblulant lifestyle of the fast pace 1970's it makes no excuses and tells no lies and offers the audience a trip back but even more importantly the movie gives us a grand example of how films should be made and a new director whose bold visions bring back art in film	positive
have just got back from seeing this brilliantly funny film granted part of the reason i loved it so was because i could point out people and places i knew 'i walk there everyday ' 'i work there ' 'i've had drinks there ' 'hey that's our postman ' etc but still if you're out for a 'feel good' with a bit of spice excuse the pun this is just the right answer relationships culture and most importantly love are all woven together within the plot with preston where the film is set recently being made a city it is good to see this work featuring the place and adding to the feeling of uprise it is also a brilliant representative of the many cultures in this part of the north fabulous	positive
i actually didn't start watching the show until it came on fx i was bored and had nothing to watch and saw that the show's reruns were premiering so i decided to watch it i was so upset that i had not watched the show when it first aired on t v i loved the show so much finally a show for everyone to enjoy i remember full house and family matters and step by step and they were okay shows but just not funny enough they would make dumb jokes and laugh over things that were just plain stupid but not that 70s show that 70s show was hilarious smart and so real i think it was the best show ever made and i'm very sorry that it ended although i love this show i do think it should have ended on the seventh season when eric and kelso leave the last season was just not right eric was the main character and the show should have ended when his character leaves i still love this show and i hope tv starts making more shows like this one	positive
if i watch a movie and don't once look at my watch or clock to see how much longer it will be running or when i hope that the last scene wasn't the end of the movie it's got to be pretty good i'm not an movie internalist or cinema dissectionist i watch movies and if they keep me interested till the end then they are pretty good because some of the most critically acclaimed films bore me to death the english patient shakespeare in love atonement crash this movie kept me interested and absorbed beginning to end acting is great story is absolutely original flash back technique very affective there was a bit of citizen kane thrown in tho when hoffman trashes his apartment after tomei leaves him but i forgive that cause i see it as a homage to rather than a rip off of orson	positive
the basic plot is good and can be engaging the music is so great that it became the theme music for the tv show iron chef though it is way overused and too intrusive in the movie so how did this movie end up so poor well the plot was about 95 predictable and the characters were about as 1 dimensional as possible and the dialog what person would actually allow themselves to receive credit for coming up with the stupid macho bull crap that purports to be dialog you get much greater realism from most cartoons the bottom line is that this movie has some good points but is so marred by hackneyed clichés and rotten dialog that it quickly becomes tiresome and this is a shame because firemen deserve a better tribute than this mess if you don't believe me look at the number of goofs listed on imdb for this movie way in excess of what you'd expect to find they just didn't care enough to work out all the kinks and problems so as a result the movie seems rushed and in need of a re write and re editing	negative
the great ecstasy of robert carmichael is bad film in every way the script the dreary pace the lack of depth in any character the pointless sub plots the dreadful acting the needless climax all make this possibly the worst film i've ever seen i found nothing likable enjoyable or intellectually stimulating in any way i imagine the film makers thought they were making something clever and dark with its moody lighting long protracted silences and vaguely haunting classical soundtrack if so they failed utterly it just bored me and i wish i had never watched it avoid at all costs	negative
i'm in a film class and i know that i don't know everything about film but truthfully this is one of the worst stupidest retarded and waste time movies that i have ever seen and i saw napolean dinamite they are both equally terrible conrack is boring and nothing interesting even happens in the film its not really a heart warming story and pat conroy overcomes nothing i'm not saying there should be fighting and crap blowing up but it would liven up this more than bland film the kids they fond to act in this film may have been the real kids from yammacraux island they sounded stupid and couldn't act as as far as i am concerned this was a stupid idea for a book and an even worse idea for a movie i don't know why this movie was even made deviantly top five worst movies of all time	negative
well i don't know what people saw in this movie i don't know i saw this movie yesterday and i got a severe headache other than few good dialog there is nothing in this movie the big b rt now is preaching to fall in love with girls of half of you age i didn't like the movie at all i wanted to give 1 rating but giving 3 as i like the role of the small girl who is called sexy by ab my word dont watch save your self donot watch this movie save time and money	negative
i admit i have been a fan of harrison ford for many many years now so it didn't surprise me that i enjoyed his performance here but i also enjoyed the way the storyline developed and thought the casting was well done i don't know whether i buy into kristin scott thomas as a congresswoman but she is a fine actress and a beautiful woman i took notice of her in the first mission impossible although her part was small she stuck out on the screen here her and ford play people whose spouses are killed in an airplane crash they are seated together and this is where the plot takes off apparently ford a police detective in wash d c discovers that his wife was having an affair he further discovers that the affair was with the husband of a new england congresswoman the story takes on many subplots as ford and thomas find themselves drawn together by revelations of their marriages the uncovering of deceipt and the pure grief and anger over the loss of a loved one i think the movie is worthwhile either renting or catching on cable	positive
this movie is about pathetic spoiled ego driven winers who think they have something interesting to say performed by pathetic spoiled ego driven winers who think they are interesting straight from the coke filled gutters of new york's arty farty incestuous drama scene how so many viewers get tricked into making them think this carries any substance remains a mystery to me maybe they secretly long to belong too to this overpaid and overestimated 'actor guild' or maybe they have never seen a decent movie get out put your hands in the dirty earth and get a real job otherwise kill your self with a real gun	negative
a lot of the films i've made probably could have worked just as well 50 years ago and that's just because i have a lot of old fashion values steven spielberg some points 1 though this film is a loose remake of a guy named joe it also borrows heavily from a matter of life and death and wings of desire 2 this was spielberg's second attempt at being frank capra 3 spielberg has often said that he wishes to make a frank capra movie in the vein of it's a wonderful life and mrs smith goes to washington judging from his recent attempts to get a harvey remake off the ground it seems as though spielberg still holds this dream the director rightfully not satisfied with his last 3 ventures into capracorn 4 critics at the time bashed always stating that the elaborate action sequences distracted from the film's romance but that's really not the problem at all the problem is that always needs a lot more special effects to distract us from the fact that spielberg can't film any line of dialogue that doesn't end in an exclamation point 5 the film is filled with comedy that just doesn't work spielberg's comedic tastes aren't very sophisticated and seem to be ripped right out of 1950's screwballs and looney tune cartoons these exaggerated antics may work in a cartoon universe but in a film it just seems like an odd marriage 6 the film's lead couple come across as brother and sister not lovers spielberg's films have always being apprehensive toward sex and intimacy but this film goes to extreme lengths she's a wisecracking tomboy and he's a wisecracking old man they're more irritating than endearing 7 the film contains one good scene in which john goodman argues with holly hunter but for the most part the film's characters are too annoying there's no subtlety every emotion overplayed every joke over designed every sequence filled with unnecessary busyness 8 always and hook taught spielberg how to con audiences after their failure and the twin financial failures of the color purple and empire of the sun spielberg dumped the goofy colour cinematography of color purple and empire of the sun in favour for the more desaturated black and white worlds of schindler's list munich minority report and saving private ryan from here on less light and dark cinematography became equated with serious topics 9 after the financial success of each dark film spielberg reverts back to his colour cinematography and falls flat on his face once again amistad followed schindler's list ai followed ryan and lincoln will follow munich these colour films are always bashed for being too tacky sentimental corny and hokey but the truth is if you removed the desaturation all these serious films would feel the same way 10 since the 70s spielberg has tried to differentiate himself from the other brat pack directors scorsese de palma coppola etc by pretending to be an optimist and humanist he would himself state this repeatedly during many interviews in the late 70s the reality though is that he is probably the biggest sadist of all these directors the very form of his films often undermining their content their very box office performances always proportionate to their dazzling displays of carnage 11 the failure of spielberg to connect with any of the characters in always and the relish he shows instead for filming forest fires air planes crashing etc perfectly encapsulates the rest of his filmography people running from dinosaurs sharks nazis tripods rocks etc this is what spielberg delights in the moment his characters stop to speak however everything self destructs a film like amistad failed in other words because not enough blacks died and too many whites talked 12 the film's flying scenes aren't up to the standard's set several years earlier in the mega hit top gun of course when your enemy is a forest fire it's hard to make things cinematic 13 failures like 1941 hook always etc are often more illuminating that spielberg's more successful films they reveal the steel skeleton beneath the technique they show what the amusement park ride looks like when its not working revealing the vacuum beneath the broken machinery 5 10 there's one good sequence here two actors in a room simply improvising but this is mostly an annoying picture with a predictable script worth one viewing	negative
some funny lines are all what makes this movie bearable the camera tv movie like the acting poor julie davis is more than disapointing and the directing amateurish and or loveless but i can understand that no one had fun to realise the overconstructed and trivial script	negative
there are some excellent comments and observations on this film i was pleased to note the comparisons to fritz lang's m forget the 50's abortive remake with lightweight david wayne the real villain is not the tortured murderer extraordinarily fine performance by jeffery demunn taking out his sexually frustrated anger on his victims mostly children he is the objective the real villain is the stifling bureaucratic soviet system drowning in its own corrupted incompetence the frustration of an uncompromisingly dedicated man rea in his best role since the crying game a facile pragmatist who's willing to use the system to his advantage sutherland always successful in this kind of role a hesitant frightened but determined psychiatrist the incomparable max sydow the bumbling boopous bureaucrat of a prosecutor brilliant brit actor john wood and the quiet supporting wife of the driven investigator delightful supporter imelda staunton this is one damn fine film its darkness and bleakness are supported by the portrayal of a corrupt incompetent system which works against success the is no need to dip into gore laden slice 'n dice sensationalism that has characterized so many recent films gore is present it's a ghastly story but it adds to the depicting of a pathologically twisted human being the success of the story is precisely that these were acts perpetrated by a person a human like you or i where you and i choose to vent our frustration by reasonable means chikatilo took his anger out on the most innocent and vulnerable of us our children the superb premise of this story is made manifest by an equally superb cast of excellent actors sadly i note that our australian friend didn't like the speech and no doubt would have preferred to hear them speaking in aussie dialect well too bad this fine film sure worked for me and everyone else i've talked with who has seen it	positive
pretentious claptrap updating herman melville about a young man's vaguely incestuous relationship with his aristocratic mother getting transferred to his long lost sister who has been raised by gypsies or something like that not that anyone really cares to unravel its multi layered plot decked out with pornographic sex scenes pseudo symbolic imagery the siblings swimming in a river of blood and other bizarre touches a gypsy child repeatedly insults passers by in the street until she is anonymously beaten to death the deafening music of a rock group utilized in the demolition of old buildings considering the source material and the presence of catherine deneuve who at least gets to bathe in the nude i was expecting a lot more from this one apparently there's an even longer tv version of pola x out there	negative
when i saw lon chaney jr and boris karloff in the cast i was expecting to find a typically schlocky 1950's style horror movie the opening scene a graveyard with a wolf howling in the background seemed to confirm this once i began watching it though what i discovered was a nifty little mystery about an englishman richard green seeking to discover what had happened to two of his friends who had disappeared in the black forest and if necessary to take revenge against the evil count stephen mcnally who ruled the territory chaney as the voiceless gargon had a rather limited role one which reminded me of the hunchback of notre dame actually while karloff had a somewhat more substantial role as dr meissen in fact meissen was one of the more interesting characters in the movie and it was difficult to know until the very end whether he would be established to be a good guy or a bad guy the castle set was magnificent and even the limited depiction of the black forest was real enough it certainly didn't come across as low budget compared to other movies i've seen anyway the only disappointment i thought was rita corday's performance as the countess she seemed somewhat dry and didn't seem to put much passion into the role that aside i found that this movie held my attention throughout and there was enough suspense about how this was all going to turn out to make it well worth the watching definitely recommended with a 7 10 rating	positive
from all the rave reviews we couldn't wait to see this show we love wacky humor and creative material especially from australia and new zealand i admit this may not be a fair review since we only saw the first 15 minutes but we just couldn't bear any more misery it was definitely the most boring and painful 15 minutes we've ever experienced watching a tv show it felt like 15 hours the songs may be mildly interesting by themselves but inserted for an interminable 3 minutes each in the middle of a story scene just doesn't work we're trying hard now to erase the memory if you want some wonderful down under humor in a delightful and engaging film see the dish instead	negative
my sister a friend and i went to see this film for my birthday on the 24th of september we had all seen the first jackass movie a while back and we all enjoyed it we were really looking forward to number two we were not disappointed from start to finish i was laughing hysterically it is equal parts shocking and amusing however and is definitely not for those with weak stomaches it is obscene but it is also groundbreaking american cinema well perhaps that's a bit too much praise for a movie where men intentionally get their scrotum's stuck to ice sculptures but it is groundbreaking in that it shows us obscenities whether we like it or not things that no other decent american movie released nation wide would dare show us there was only one scene in particular that i felt was unnecessarily obscene and it involved a horse i'll not elaborate i laughed i nearly gagged and i came damn close to crying out of a physical reaction to viewing a scene involving a leech and an eyeball not sadness in my humble opinion jackass number two is the film of '06 does that make me a jackass perhaps but if it does i could really care less	positive
the only remarkable fact is the participation of klaus kinski who plays a priest don't ask me why he does it a bad bad movie overall	negative
another winner from that 50s 60s era that i love so much for the comedic value they give with each viewing these days corman never lets you down with these films they take themselves seriously and they have very low budgets a recipe for good watching for sure ed nelson a very competent actor got started with corman as well as many other favorites who show up in superman and many of the westerns of the day the costume is pretty bad and the sound of the alien speaking well the reverb was a little off but thats the beauty of it film making for the love of it not looking for perfection just digging the action of doing it it comes thru these films are a fun time even better is the mst3k version	negative
betty is an understudy for the lead in a production of verdi's macbeth when a car mysteriously hits the lead betty is thrust into the spotlight opening night is a smashing success and betty decides to leave the after party to celebrate in private with her boyfriend but when the boyfriend leaves the room betty is grabbed from behind by an unknown black gloved masked figure the unknown assailant ties betty to a column gags her and places needles under her eyes that will cause incredible damage and pain should betty close them the boyfriend returns to the room and is stunned to see betty in such a predicament he's even more shocked when the killer grabs him and shoves a knife through his lower jaw with such force the tip of the knife can clearly be seen in his mouth and betty has been forced to watch all of this so begins betty's terrifying ordeal with a killer not just intent on hurting her but also on forcing her to watch as he mutilates her friends opera gets classified as a giallo but to me it differs in quite a few ways from the model less emphasis is placed on the mystery elements of the story than in something like argento's tenebre or the bird with the crystal plumage the black gloved masked killer may be omnipresent but the clues and red herrings normally associated with a good giallo are absent instead opera is all about the tension of an unknown killer and making the audience uncomfortable the focus is on the grisly death scenes betty's fear and the killer's obsession with betty opera features what i think are some of argento most artistic death scenes when the killer grabs betty after her boyfriend leaves the room you're sure that betty's had it but the sadistic killer only wants to force betty to watch as he brutally stabs her lover in the neck the knife emerging in his mouth it's a well shot and designed scene and those needles in the eyes brilliant or take the death of the seamstress at first her death seems like an ordinary run of the mill murder but when the seamstress accidentally swallows the killer's locket what started out as just another death scene turns it up a notch as the killer uses a pair of scissors to cut the girl's throat open to get his chain finally there's the most famous death scene in opera that i'm amazed with each time i see it mira is shot in the eye while peering through a keyhole that scene displays a lot of what i like about argento it's got style to burn as implausible as it may be it's creative memorable and a blast to watch argento certainly wasn't the first italian director to concentrate on eye mutilation but in opera he's taken eye trauma to a new level needles holding eyes open a bullet in the eye and ravens pecking out an eye are all part of argento's vision pun intended and these scenes do have the effect that i believe argento was going for the first time i saw the killer putting those needles in betty's eyes i couldn't stop blinking it actually had a physical effect on me what is it about the eyes that make them such a target for abuse in italian films to be fair and not sound like such a fanboy there are problems i have with opera that keep me from rating it as argento's best one of my problems is with the air duct system running through betty's apartment building while i don't doubt there are air duct systems in older apartment buildings that connect the apartments the ducts in opera are huge i'm no expert but i sincerely doubt any building like the one in this movie would have had such mammoth air ducts it doesn't seem practical at all and don't you think someone would have done something about them long ago to keep criminals and nosey neighbors out of the other apartments it's convenient for the plot but it's not very realistic but i suppose my major problem with the film comes with the finale what's up with that ending it feels totally out of place tacked on and like a bad afterthought i'm not sure what else to say other than it's horrible	positive
i have seen this movie just once and i'm looking forward to see it again and again dear david from beligium why did you bother to write a comment on this movie i only think we can think about you after reading you comment is that you're provably a non sexual person like erika in the movie and you are not ready for the new cinema that is coming up i guess you are a bit old and sexual expression is not part of your visage the cannes film festival is by far the best movie festival and i'm is my pleasure to say that this film was awarded with best actress best actor and grand prix isabelle huppert is magnificent as always who would do this movie like her one of her best performances ever the music is fantastic and once more michael haneke puts reality in the big screen it's like a dogma95 kind of movie because of the topic try to see it	positive
i loved dedee pfeiffer is that spelled right in cybil haven't seen her for awhile and forgot how much i missed her i thought she did a great job in this the supporting cast was pretty good too in some angles the daughter even looked like a young nicole kidman the abductor was pretty creepy and the story generally had some good twists the young boyfriend was a hottie i thought the husband definitely had something to do with it for sure just got the lifetime movie network for christmas and am loving these movies kept my interest and i'll watch it again when they rerun it can anyone else recommend any similar movies to this you can post on the board or send me a private email if you want thanks in advance aboutagirly	positive
wow i loved this movie this film was filled with plot twists good acting great story and a surprising ending to be completely honest this movie wasn't overly gory it does contain some gore though but was more on the psychological side i read it on the internet the film cost 3000 dollars and was shoot in 8 days amazing this is for someone that wants to think and loves great film making what starts out as a terrorizing thriller slowly transforms into something a bit more twisted even a bit more sinister not much i can say without giving away plot points only that this movie went beyond my expectations	positive
a quiet sweet and beutifully nostalgic movie on how it is to be confronted with old friends and surroundings from your youth with all that memories and the problems and sorrows of the present with you a movie that makes you feel good all the ingredients are here old jelousy rivalry friendship and loyalty mischief nightly fridge raids and all the other fun stuff that we all remember from our summer camps all the characters get the opportunity for a week to experience this again as the old camp leader now is retiring and want to meet the children from the golden years of the camp all of them are now in their thirties and in the middle of their careers	positive
what i liked best in this film is that like the films of hitchcock it is a thriller that does not take itself too seriously hitchcock understood that people go the the movies to have a good time something that hollywood seems to have forgotten in recent years this is a thriller but it has plenty of laughs and always has one eye winking at the camera rachel mcadams is wonderful as always cillian murphy is creepier than he was in batman begins in the old days there were guys who always played the bad guy we don't see much of that these days because i suspect the hollywood agents consider it a bad career move but cillian murphy is really good at being bad the directing is surprising stylish the story is good but the dialog could have used some sprucing up red eye is a really fun film and people were applauding when the closing credits started rolling if you are in the mood for an enjoyable escapist thriller red eye might be your ticket	positive
i'm not a big fan of rom coms at the best of times a few have been quite good check of dream for an insomniac but this one is just more of the same but less with a running time of 100min i expect more than 1 laugh every 30mins the only real belly laugh are when male strangers and friends instinctively help out lee's character all i can say is avoid i guarantee there is at least 10 other movies on the shelf that deserve you 3 of out 10 and only cos i'm a big lee fan	negative
sophmoric this film is but it is funny as all get out it shows the boys locker room mentality being played by the other side it is good to see such tides turned and how silly they are but that's probably not news to most women 'cause just ask one they've heard 'em all before watch it with a small group or party of mixed gender and 97 3 of the room will laugh for 2 hours straight and the other 2 7 can you ever really please them	positive
susan seidelman seems to have had a decent career with a few top notch credits under her belt i'm certainly glad she bounced back from this film which seems to have its admirers i'm not one of them i've seen better acting in high school plays than i did in smithereens the plot such as it is involved young susan berman who is ambitious to make it in the world of music and is willing to do just about anything to get there she even rejects the sincere advances of a young artist who is living out of his van off the east river played by brad rijn young mr rijn contributes the worst performance in the film in fact one of the worst acting jobs i've seen in a long time no wonder he's not gone anywhere i will say that seidelman's eye for the camera is a good one in capturing the familiar east village locations where the film was mostly shot but her work with her live performers didn't measure up i'm not sure she had that much raw material to work with look fast and you'll see a very young christopher noth before law and order and sex in the city as a street hustler if you like punk rock you might sit through this for the soundtrack i'll stick to bing crosby	negative
as the 2000's came to a close king kong's adopted daughter went ahead and made a tearful announcement her show as coming to an end while miss winfrey was tearing up i was laughing and screaming like a wild indian from the old west so what does oprah do she takes famous people and puts them on her show what kind of famous people people who've suffered just like her except these people have lost more than their virginity they've suffered melted faces true story missing limbs true story see end of paragraph and spousal abuse too many to count and somehow they come on the show and tell their story as if we haven't heard it before tons and tons of times bethany hamilton i've heard your tale about losing an arm to a shark since day one which was october 31st 2003 don't tell me you have no hard feelings but the biggest thing probably on oprah was michael jackson's interview in 1993 after being accused of being a child molester sadly mr jackson has since passed away but that one particular show told about michael's personal life something not many people knew about at the time oprah's real influence comes from middle aged women and soccer moms they seem to think she's like a personal jesus sometimes but all i see in oprah is some big ghetto lady who made it big and she's just showing off how rich she is i'm glad her shows going to end soon we need better television programs	negative
four stories about the drug trade in europe become intertwined over the course of this 6 part miniseries in germany a businessman is arrested on drug smuggling charges and his wife attempts to save her family by continuing her husband's illegal trade meanwhile the british home secretary travels to pakistan to negotiate an aid package that he hopes will stop the drug flow from that country even as he does this however his own daughter succumbs to heroin addiction tearing their family apart this is the miniseries on which the american film and miniseries were based the original is far superior to its two decendants the poverty and desperation of the third world are portrayed very well it is stark uncompromising and brutal	positive
due to a very misleading advertising campaign i saw this film in theatres at the relatively young age of 10 the trailers on tv portrayed the film as a comedy and i bugged my parents until they took me after seeing the movie i was blown away i had no idea what to think totally different than anything i had seen before leaving far to many questions for such a young mind needless to say i loved it this morning was the first time i'd watched in in probably 2 3 years and i still think it's one of the greatest films made in the last decade kevin spacey and jeff bridges are both in top form as a mysterious man who may or may not be from another planet and the psychiatrist that develops a bond with him while trying to decipher his mystery the supporting cast are near perfect as well each resident of the mental institution is incredibly convincing in their own way the open ending was handled very well giving lots of evidence to support whatever you believe happened in the end how this movie failed to receive at least a nomination in that year's oscars is beyond me if you haven't seen this film run to wal mart right now the dvd is usually in the bargain bin pick it up 9 5 10	positive
harsh yes but i call 'em like i see 'em i saw this in the late 80's and it was truly one of the most awful boring films i've ever forced myself to watch yes the cinematography is lovely the czech settings are truly stunning the political backdrop is enticing but unlike similar historically set stories e g _dr zhivago_ qv this one failed to make the politics relevant to the story or even interesting sure olin and binoche are beautiful but this film manages to make even erotic scenes plodding and slow i'm all for romance but this movie was so boring i started hoping the russians would shoot them all and put an end to my misery i'm sure if i'd read the book the story would have made a bit more sense however life's too short to expend any more time on this one	negative
this work is pretty atmospheric with a couple of surprises a few really creepy elements i found this work more rewarding than i first expected given the rotten reviews this receives here at imdb the dialog comes across as natural and honest given the circumstances although the overall run of the film goes from predictable to cliché with the heroines falling down when they should be running and investigating strange noises when they should be locking their doors typical horror movie fare the local characters are some of the worst clichés depicting appalachian natives as in bred developmentally challenged freaks the characters of the children and the principals are great the development given is adequate and scout taylor compton seems to be developing her talents quite well now i'm not going to say that this is entirely original or the best thing since sliced bread which isn't all that great by the way but this is interesting and i do not long for my 107 minutes back i would not say this is an awesome movie by any means but there are some really good horror elements herein but there are also some really slow spots where plot character development seem superfluous to the director's or the film editor's whim all in all this is good for a rainy night but not so good for a friday saturday night's viewing it rates a 7 6 10 from the fiend	positive
one star for the plot one star for the acting one star for the dubbing into squeaky voiced american five stars for monica broeke and inge maria granzow with their propensity for taking all their clothes off and ten out of ten for the divine emmanuelle béart two years before she made 'manon des sources' béart also undresses a couple of times but even fully clothed her presence is enough to make this film eminently watchable watch out for the scene where she tells her friend about the three first times for a girl it's corny but still far more erotic than the rather laughably choreographed love scenes featuring broeke granzow and patrick bauchau incidentally the cinematography is not great the stills for the closing credits are a better indication of what david hamilton is capable of	negative
yes it's another great magical muppet's movie and i adore them all the characters the movies the tv show episodes it's the best comedy or musical tv show ever and all the artists behind it but here they did such a rare fatal mistake and i'm surely talking about the weird ending i think it's very dangerous to involve that much in american drama and end a love affair by marriage we as all the poor viewers feel so free or maybe happy for the absence of its annoyance peevishness and misery so we all enjoy these stories which gather 2 cute heroes as couple in love without the legitimate bond like mickey mouse and minnie superman and lois lane dick tracy and tess etc so with all of the previous couples and their likes i bet that you feel safe serenity and peace therefore when you look at what the makers of this movie had already done you'll be as mad as me they made the weak miserable creature kermit marry his daily nightmare the most vexatious female ever miss piggy this is a historical change by the measures of the american entertainment's industry and it was pretty normal to have a negative impact upon the audience whom just refused to bless or believe or being satisfied with that sudden marriage even the pathetic frog didn't have the time or the proper opportunity to think or to decide anything therefore no wonder at all when you know that this movie is the most failure one in their cinematic serious grossing only 25 millions vis à vis 65 millions earned by the first one the muppet movie 1979 five years earlier simply in this movie they took manhattan and my rest too	positive
'til there was you is one of the worst films we've ever seen it fails in every respect jeanne tripplehorn was better as an actress in waterworld in comparison this film is dungworld when a character stumbles once or even twice in the course of a film one can understand it but jeanne's character falls trips stumbles so often that she might have a bit of jerry lewis in her in her defence each prat fall was probably blocked choreographed and rehearsed and rehearsed although this is bad enough for a film the actors dylan mcdermott and jeanne tripplehorn seem to spend most of the plot going out for a smoke or trying to find a place to smoke if the film was a diatribe on having no place to smoke ok but it isn't however long this film runs it is too long by 10 minutes past the running time oh jeanne tripplehorn almost acts in a public forum meeting you almost see her break life into the character oh it's almost as convincing as her scene yelling at michael douglas in basic instinct hmm on second thought not really this is a film to avoid at all costs unless you need a cigarette and are trapped in nicotine addicts anonymous or forced to watch outtakes of hooper burt reynolds and even then toss a coin or go to sleep	negative
recovery is an incredibly moving piece of work handling the devastating effects of brain injury on not only the individual but the entire family without resorting to preaching or hollywood sappy endings tony marchant's drama presents a family in crisis in a realistic way highest praise goes david tennant and sarah parish for their incredible performances i had presumed before watching the drama that i would see some of their previous on screen relationship in blackpool bleed through but it never does neither actor is recognizable from any previous work and i didn't see either of them as an actor playing a part during the entire 90 minutes in addition harry treadaway's performance as the son just on the cusp of starting his own life in university was fantastic throughout the piece he shows the torn nature of a teenage boy thrown into the unwilling role as man of the house at times nearly every character in the drama is unsympathetic as the viewer i wanted to give each of them a good smack to wake up to reality stop moping and start adjusting to the rotten but very present change in their lives but under the same circumstances i see myself acting like any of them switching between trying to show the stiff upper lip to desperation to escape to anything including behavior that is completely unlike myself it's the show's greatest strength truth without sugar coating to force us all to think what we'd be able to do under the same circumstances this is a difficult but must watch show i hope that it somehow manages to be shown in the u s	positive
the western society has been fed ideas about india being a poor country movies like these only make those beliefs stronger such illustrations make it all the more difficult for indians to be accepted abroad agreed there are poor and homeless in india but why is there no representation of educated people if not the successful ones i totally hated the idea of the movie portraying patrick swayze as another mother teressa in my opinion this movie has shown india in a very bad light giving wrong notions it is unjust to discuss only one aspect of the society exactly the reason why people ask me when we go to india can we hire an elephant right outside the airport so we do not have to walk on the roads so full of filth and snakes those who want a second opinion on contemporary indian society should watch monsoon wedding	negative
intense funny witty and more than anything social comedy on the ways of adult dating and it's results be it good or bad mohr and nicholson are engaged couple two months away from a wedding date when a bizarre event at their engagement party forces nicholson to re think the relationship and start to date other people so she won't feel so pristine when it comes to sexual experience this leads to a disaster of events following mohr nicholson and their cohorts very intelligent and needed in this time of clumsy condescending comedy while containing your usual variety of comedic sexual and frustrated characters especially charles as a sexually frustrated sex fiend very annoying who even they seem to get the right feel to this heart felt commentary the film goes the way films should go these days showing that guys are sensitive at heart and have morals most of the male characters are the moralistic straight forward eyes while the woman are the fresh faced street prowlers who will stop at nothing to get pleasure guys will be appreciative of the message made for guys with self respect however it is easy to assume that most males who do see this film will use it's message of male sensitivity cover up any flaw or trait that a female might find offending still the writing formula uses this as a tool to pave the way for it's male leads particularly those of mohr richter and finding the director in a cameo as a sales man the females are by far the most promiscuous as they speak of nothing but pleasure and what it would be like to with someone else they have amicable traits though even though they are covered by the image of sex driven kittens very funny stuff on another level the film follows some of it's ensemble into different relationship work richter meets up with a stressed divorcée a very remarkable and noteworthy performance by the always reliable helen slater named penelope who is divorced with a son who hates her for splitting with his father as the two go deeper into a relationship human interest is revealed and both the comedy and tragedy of divorce and starting anew are studied by the end of the film mohr and nicholson have become way to deep over the heads to see what's coming next and it is up to what they have learned about each other and themselves to decide what will come next it becomes appropriate and dramatic at just the right time wallodorski's direction is emulated very well when the characters learn to face each other after all that has happened with the right ending all in all this film should have been released nationwide and i should hope that it is up for some academy awards maybe helen slater can finally get the recognition she deserves anywho this film is a no hits miss give it all you got romantic sex farce displayed very maturely and aesthetically great film	positive
i loved flash gordon as a child and watching the series again on dvd brings back such fond memories each 15 minute episode features the adventures of our hero flash the lovely dale arden and intrepid dr zarkov on the planet mongo with flash escaping death at every turn the shark men nearly drown him he faces the fire monster in the tunnel of terror and he's in mortal peril in the static room the characters are still fun buster crabbe is every bit the blonde dreamboat hero and jean rogers is a delicate and beautiful dale arden princess aura still plots to steal flash for herself king vultan of the hawk men still has his booming laugh and angel wings and ming the merciless emperor of the universe is still giving everyone the evil eye and the creeps this serial probably wouldn't interest children today with its hokey effects oh that spaceship but it's a fun bit of nostalgia for those who liked it the first time around the actors play it straight and don't play down to kids i appreciate that young viewers were expected to read the chapter synopses which had pretty big words in them i'm glad this came out on dvd it's a lot of fun to revisit this classic sci fi serial	positive
i was thinking that the main character the astronaut with the bad case of the runs in his case his skin hair muscles etc could always get more movie work after he'd been reduced to a puddle all he has to do is get a job as the blob the premise of this flick is pretty lame an astronaut gets exposed to sunspot radiation i think and so begins to act like an ice cream cone on a hot day not only is this a puzzler but apparently he has to kill humans and consume their flesh so that he can maintain some kind of cell integrity huh have you ever noticed that whenever any kind of radiation accident or experiment happens the person instantly turns into a killing machine why is that the astronaut lumbers off into the night from the 'secret facility' which has no security whatsoever shedding parts of himself as he goes apparently he retains just enough memory to make him head for the launch pad maybe because he wanted to return to space thus begins the part of the movie that's pretty much filler with a doctor wandering around with a geiger counter trying to find the melting man by the buzz he gives off he kills a stupid bill gates look alike fisherman scares a little girl a la the frankenstein monster movie and finishes off a wacky older couple punishing them karmically for stealing some lemons then there's a short scene where he whacks his former general and a very long scene where he kills a young pothead and chases his girlfriend around you'd think that after she cuts his arm off and he run away the scene would shift but no we're treated to about ten minutes of the woman huddled into a corner panting and screaming in terror even though the monster is gone all i could think was director's girlfriend anyone the end of the movie is even lamer than the rest of it the melting man finishes turning into a pile of goo and then nothing that's it that's the end of the movie well at least that meant that there was no room for a sequel	negative
attention possible spoilers this film is so lousy that it actually becomes funny the director has put in all the clichés that have ever plagued b series movies the stupid bimbo nice rack getting caught again and again by the bad guys chief villain smirky and revealing his plots before they happen so they can be ruined and who of course bullied killed the hero's father in an unclear past a side kick in the person of a policeman small bald and whose only preparation for the last battle another cliché is returning his baseball cap rim backwards etc the film's end really tops it after the chief villain dies when the hero paralised stoneface jack or whatever throws him from the roof of a building ten stories high they walk out of the building which from the exteriors looks three stories high only and very much like your regular city hall when they exit the building the side kick can't walk being that his right leg appears to be wounded how nobody can tell ten minutes earlier he fell down shot in his shoulder and his feet were fine there is no further explanation for the inquisitive mind of the viewer who would be curious to know such trivial things as where is the villain's body which should lay near the building and why is there no police or even curious folks gathered round the said body i could go on forever with the list why does another one of the bad guys claim to have invented martial arts when he gets his ass kicked in no time why do bad guys in general make silly movements when attacking why does the hero look so faggy is there anyone really thinking yes these characters and this plot makes this a film to remember and the actors suck our hero and saviour of the day wears the same expression on his face the whole film that disgusted trying to be cocky smirk must be some copyrighted feat of him also thinking that until now 12 of the people having rated this film gave it a 10 makes me full of fear inside they might have been serious and then we're doomed	negative
i guess my biggest mistake was to watch this remake of '95 piranha back to back with joe dante's '78 original i did the same last week with the omen curiously enough watching the remake right after the '76 original really made me appreciate the 2006 version quite a bit for various reasons but this approach sort of backfired on the '95 piranha version it enhanced the fact that it really is a lesser picture basically the '95 version is more or less the exact same film as it tells the same story and follows it practically scene by scene only barabara steele's character and the military intervention were written out of it but the cinematography wasn't as good the acting was worse too especially alexandra paul playing heather menzies' character showed me again what a horrible actress she is bradford dillman from the '78 version had his charlton heston way of acting going which was amusing while in the '95 version william katt does a good job at being william katt so i didn't mind him really but the whole cast is pretty much inferior and the only worthwhile event was spotting james karen return of the living dead parts 1 2 in a cameo john carl buechler's make up effects aren't as neat as rob bottin's the musical score had some ring to it but pino donaggio's score was much more memorable in the original so all these shortcomings really shone through with having just re watched the original as part of this double bill since scott p levy's remake does follow dante's original i guess it is entertaining enough to sit through though it's lacking the wit dante's original had but what really made me not like levy's version very much is the fact that quite a bit of stock footage from the first film was re used during the piranha attack scenes i never like it when filmmakers do this and i'm not talking about using footage for flashbacks or other valid reasons i mean if you don't have the budget or imagination to come up with newly shot material then for pete's sake don't do a frickin' remake but roger corman produced this cheaper remake so i guess i shouldn't be all that surprised about the re use of footage if you do decide to watch piranha then make sure it's been a while since you've seen the original you might enjoy this remake a little more then and oh yes that cool little stop motion creature from the original is nowhere to be found in this film as to be expected but what's worse there also isn't any female nudity in this one the original really had quite some titty shots going for it and that blonde girl from the opening scene even accidentally pulled her underwear a bit down too far when removing her jeans figures as this '95 version was made for tv	negative
when you actually find a video game to be scary or disturbing you know that the developers have done some very serious and hard work to make the whole thing work undying used the unreal engine but had very little resemblance to that game when it came to actual gameplay speaking of gameplay the pace is slowed down and the sheer difficulty in progressing through the very hard to kill enemies makes for a very unqiue gameplay experience the production values are so high that you may even forget that it is a video game the game itself is also packed with loads of secrets that you have to uncover using special vision the level design in fantastic and the weapons as well as the enemies will really shock you	positive
i was in a bad frame of mind when i first saw this movie for some reason it clicked on all my levels tensions in a family loneliness and the want of someone to share your life with it didn't hurt that the someone to share your life with was such a beautiful girl as claire cyndy preston i also bought the sound track to this movie very hard to get loved it and hope it will someday come out on dv	positive
when i took my seat in the cinema i was in a cool mood and didn't plan on changing it but this movie is a dramatic powerhouse i was all in sweat and needed a shower afterward so what have we theoretically a coming of age story of a teenage turkish girl living in copenhagen denmark it came to my mind soon that the plot seemed pretty much completely borrowed from bend it like beckham where we had an indian girl playing football and spoiling the wedding of her sister here we have it transferred to a turkish girl spoiling her brother's wedding by doing kung fu and we have a love story and a competition of course too after i accepted this this really turned out to be a gripping emotional drama and it shows off some beautiful kung fu i'm not an expert though the lead actress semra turan is not only denmark's female champion but she also delivers an excellent performance so that it appears to be safe to assume that we have quite some autobiographic impressions here taking into account that this is her first movie and that she has no education as an actress rest of the supporting cast is okay camera good kung fu intense sidenotes the male turkish audience showed respect so that they must have done something right the audience burst into cheers when our heroine finally fought back and attacked the boys who were gravely beating up her brother in revenge xian gao a chinese cinematic kung fu instructor actor hidden tiger crouching dragon played the lead role's master if you get the chance to see this in cinema do it you'll probably have a good and intense experience and i don't know if this works on small screen as well	positive
this movie has a lot of comedy not dark and gordon liu shines in this one he displays his comical side and it was really weird seeing him get beat up his training is unorthodox and who would've thought knot tying could be so deadly lots of great stunts and choreography very creative add johnny wang in the mix and you've got an awesome final showdown don't mess with manchu thugs they're ruthless	positive
this film had no huge stars in it but did have a very good cast filled with excellent supporting actors and gene tierney before she became a big star with george sanders reginald gardner harry carey bruce cabot jospeh calleia and cederic hardwicke you'd expect more from the film than it actually delivered most of this i suspect is because of a second rate script as director henry hathaway was a competent and well established man at the helm the film is set in east africa during wwii just before the americans entered the war the brits are trying to control their african colonies while subversive nazi elements are trying to stir up trouble among the locals one of the white men in the film is a double dealer working for the destruction of the british empire but lovely tierney playing a sultan's daughter is out to help save the day for good ol' britain american film makers have long sided with the empire and the 1930s and 40s saw a plethora of pro empire films nowadays with changed sensibilities the notion of seeing the happy black natives dying for queen and country seems ridiculous and it would be hard to root for either side still in its day this propaganda piece was effective in drumming up support for the british though when seen today the film suffers from a long winded script and silly casting the one bright moment in the film is the final showdown between george sanders and the enemy agent too bad after such a potent scene the film just seemed to talk and talk losing some of its punch	negative
if your a child of the 80's and have not seen this movie you have failed to be a true child of the 80's how can you not love those great chipmunks don't forget about the chippettes lines and songs years later i can still sing every word to every song the story line is great and much better then the films for kids today it's just pure fun and worth the rent even if your all grown up	positive
les visiteurs the first movie about the medieval time travelers was actually funny i like jean reno as an actor but there was more there were unexpected twists funny situations and of course plain absurdness that would remind you a little bit of louis de funes now this sequel has the same characters the same actors in great part and the same time traveling the plot changes a little since the characters now are supposed to be experienced time travelers so they jump up and down in history without paying any attention to the fact that it keeps getting absurder as you advance in the movie the duke jean reno tries to keep the whole thing together with his playing but his character has been emptied so there's not a lot he can do to save the film now the duke's slave helper he has really all the attention the movie is merely about him and his being clumsy annoying stupid or whatever he was supposed to be fact is this character tries to produce the laughter from the audience but he does not succeed it is as if someone was telling you a really very very bad joke you already know but he insists on telling that joke till the end adding details to make your suffering a little longer if you liked les visiteurs do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel if you didn't like les visiteurs you would never consider seeing the sequel if you liked this sequel well i suppose you still need to see a lot of movies	negative
this movie gives you more of an idiea how australians act even though the castle is a great australian movie it's a bit out there this movie is by far the best aussie flick i have seen haven't seen dirty deeds yet and probably would be my favourite movie the point is if you haven't seen it go see it if a crime action comedy is your thing	positive
there's something about a movie that features female bodybuilders that gets me in front of the screen every time i've seen pumping iron ii aces iron eagle iii raven hawk and even the tv movie getting physical which featured some big names in the sport they were tolerable in their own ways mostly because they featured rachel mclish rowwr then i went and watched nemesis iii prey harder on the sole basis that it featured such luminaries as sue price debbie muggli sharon bruneau and ursula sarcev love the ladies always will but after this i'm kinda glad i missed the first two nemesis flicks well the first one anyway most of the footage here is lifted bodily and kicking and screaming i would guess from nemesis ii actually that one looked marginally entertaining from the evidence supplied here but even though price and company flex and pose they don't get much of a chance to do anything else like say act in fact this whole film is an exercise get it ha ha in oblique story telling ambiguous characters and open ended movie making in terms of filming as well as the story line nothing makes much sense but even if it did there would still be issues such as making such small parts for such larger than life women as these what a crime of course it was written and directed by albert pyun so what did you expect cohesion one star only in consideration for all the hard work that price muggli bruneau and sarcev obviously put into their bodies not the craft work done within the movie itself thanks ladies	negative
just once i'd like to see a version of beowulf where it appears the screenwriters have at least a passing familiarity with the original poem yet again after watching this sci fi presentation i'm disappointed i'm not suggesting the writers need to understand and analyze the poem in old english but i wish they could at least try to read a translation in modern english and attempt to construct a story based on what actually transpires the story is exciting enough why add plot elements that are non existent and ruin the story what's wrong with being faithful to the text grendel is immune to weapons of any kind why introduce some super crossbow that is unbelievable and could not have possibly existed in this time period as correctly pointed out by the previous reviewer the fight with grendel was beowulf vs grendel that's it no one else took part in the battle the only way beowulf could have defeated him was by choosing specifically to engage the monster without any weapons the mistake made by all previous challengers yet in this version danes and geats fight the beast and beowulf hacks off grendel's arm with a sword again why couldn't they portray what really happened personally i think a one on one grappling match between the two would be much more exciting overall this is a pathetic and abysmal depiction that is faithless to the true tale why add in a pact with hrothgar and grendel's mother that includes sacrificial offering why create extra characters like finn that add nothing to the story there was no love story in the poem they couldn't even set the scenes in the appropriate locations a forest instead of the swamp and no lair under the lake they fail to notice the metaphor that grendel's lair signifies it's supposed to be underground to represent hell why not instead center on the symbolism inherent in the epic poem even my high school students last year were able to do immensely better when they created a short film based on beowulf since they focused on the themes and symbolism underlying the story if hollywood could create a film that centers on these elements and is faithful to the plot then that would be a truly great movie	negative
watching this movie and then listening to the commentary it's clear that michael radford doesn't understand this play the first clue that he fails to fully grasp the work is that he takes pains to set the film in seventeenth century venice which sounds truly odd yes that misunderstanding the film would mean trying to make it as accurate to its location as possible but anyone who's studied shakespeare knows that while he set most of his plays in exotic locals the culture and values are always contemporary england this doesn't hurt the film but it displays a lack of necessary knowledge where radford kills the film is in making it so dead serious he manages to suck every joke out of the script leaving the whole production flat every ounce of passion is beaten out of the characters even shylock's 'do we not bleed' speech is a mild awkward ranting from a choleric who seems to only be saying and doing what he does because he's supposed to the lovers are solemn and far too restrained joseph fiennes delivers some of the most romantic lines in the cinema this year in a barely audible whisper gratiano who has to promise to behave at one point is more sober and collected than bassiano who makes him promise to behave jessica is reluctant to leave her father and spends her life with lorenzo pouting in the commentary for the bland and watered down court scene the director voices his shock that an audience laughed at portia's 'a pound of flesh no more no less' sentence ultimately concluding that it had to tension release laughter 'the merchant of venice' is a comedy and radford scoffs at the idea that the most absurd and hysterical portions of the story are anything but the most daringly provocative drama the film has no intelligible focus yet cuts out some of the most entertaining scenes the characters are forced into high drama veils so they come out sounding like ibsen characters reading victorian poetry and the comedic ending where all of the good guys go to bed happy is drowned in a dignified despair that feels like they're finding stiff upper lip peace with impending death rather than reconciling with lovers even lancelot and antonio exit the film holding their hats like aristocratic mourners the film is poorly done because the creative powers that be don't understand the script it is stern where it should hysterical it is reserved where it should be passionate it is michael radford where it should be william shakespeare	negative
i have to agree with everyone else that has posted i watched it quite a while ago but i'll tell you whenever i hear certain music from this anime i am reminded of the story the beautiful animation the characters and the feeling i got when watching it and it does make me cry such a happy yet sad feeling i do however find that the love story in it felt alittle rushed and they didn't explain things properly but it didn't ruin any part of the viewing experience i was into this anime so much that after the end i just had to do some research and watch the ending a few more times and i found all my answers and a whole lot more i love how they configured historical legends to fit into this anime it was amazing and just made me want to research a whole lot more i've always been very interested in certain historical figures associated with this anime i do think it should have been a longer series but if this is all they had to work with then they pulled it off nicely i'd recommend this to anyone who likes emotional anime with an excellent story well built characters some mysterious and a bit of fantasy action also even though this was based on a h game it doesn't have any of that stuff in it and i actually prefer it this way i have no problem with mature anime in most cases i prefer it	positive
i loved this movie and will watch it again original twist to plot of man vs man vs self i think this is kurt russell's best movie his eyes conveyed more than most actors words perhaps there's hope for mankind in spite of government intervention	positive
well it has to be said that monster man is a huge mess of a film but somehow multiple different genres and a clichéd plot come together to make one of the most enjoyable modern horror films i've seen in ages the two biggest styles that the film mixes are a 'road trip' style teenage comedy and a 'texas chainsaw massacre' style redneck horror vibe and while one gets in the way of the other quite often director michael davis manages to keep things moving thanks to the fact that the constant shift in tone means that we're never quite sure where the film is going to be taken next things start out worryingly as we're introduced to two characters both irritating in different ways adam is a wussy virgin while harley is a fat big mouthed a hole they're both driving across the desert to attend the wedding of some chick they both liked in high school after a couple of strange events they pick up a hitch hiker and then find themselves being chased by some maniac in a monster truck for reasons unknown the idea of someone being chased by someone else in a bigger vehicle is hardly original but the way the monster truck is used here is one of the film's biggest assets the truck itself looks spooky because it's so haggard and rusty and the fact that it bounces around the screen makes the unfolding action exciting and suspenseful after a while you begin to get used to the characters and once aimee brooks enters the fray things start to look up the teen comedy side of the movie actually works pretty well as justin ulrich is always on hand to deliver some entertaining lines of dialogue and the scenes between the dorky virgin and the hot female hitch hiker are interesting enough just when you think the film couldn't possibly get any messier things take a turn for the weird in the final third without spoiling things it has to be said that monster man features the sort of ending that couldn't possibly be seen coming and along with the twist is a big surprise some people may feel ripped off by the sudden turn at the end but i actually thought it worked quite well as it fits the film in that nothing here really fits overall this isn't a 'great' film by any means but if you're looking for some silly entertainment monster man should hit the spot	positive
my wife and i like to rent really stupid horror sci fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh we saw this one on fullmoondirect com and decided to add it to our netflix list now when i say this movie is awful i mean it in a good way everything about it the acting camera work story costumes is just so cheezy and low budget but thats what makes it so good i think in one scene the actors looked like they were actually walking in place i really hope that whoever made this film wasn't serious when they made it because if they were then that would just be sad if you like to watch really stupid horror movies just to make fun of them then i recommend this one	negative
i thought this film was just about perfect the descriptions summaries you'll read about this movie don't do it justice the plot just does not sound very interesting but it is just rent it and you will not be sorry	positive
the movie is excellent acting cinematography direction and music are spellbinding it seems to me that the reason so many give the movie a low score is because of the devotion they have to the original 1937 version starring ronald coleman that movie for good reason engendered an unbelievable level of commitment from talking with people who saw the original when it first came out i believe the impact was something akin to the first starwars movie in modern times i have seen it it was and is wonderful but that does not mean that this version is not also worthy from the first scene the 1973 version grabs you the noise and tumult are fantastic especially in they way they prepare you for the peace of shangri la and burt bacharach's music is beautiful so by all means enjoy the 1937 version but do not let it detract from your enjoyment of this 1973 version any more than you would let the 1935 king kong destroy peter jackson's of this year	positive
prisons are not exactly renowned for their kind hospitality and 'happy vibes' what with stories of fights chaos murder and of course extreme male bonding but the prison in this film is a different beast altogether horror films set in cells are as you probably know nothing particularly new as they emphasis and exaggerate the fear of claustrophobia and the inability of escape two of the greatest themes in horror cinema with such examples as the chair waldermar korzeniowsky 1988 the green mile frank darabont 1999 alien 3 david fincher 1992 and of course the entire women in prison exploitation genre itself another entry into this niche has to be something inventive and a lot of fun to boot in order to be recognised or at least that's what you'd have thought prison is certainly an incredibly fun and enjoyable ride and it's somewhat of a shame that it isn't as well known as it should be the film in short centres on an old prison well duh which has been reopened however it's not just fellow inmates and guards the prisoners have to fear but also a mean ass demon ghost spirit with only one thing on its mind death and boy are we treated to some awesome death scenes i won't spoil anything here for you but there are plenty of innovative and enjoyable murders all done by invisible hands besides the special effects and the murders this film also has another thing going for it it's cast headlining we have lord of the rings peter jackson 2001 2003 star viggo mortensen and for all those so inclined yes he does get naked whose performance is not only highly believable but is done with such skill that his eastwood esquire character is both bad to the bone and likable a very delicate mix add him to a cast of 'hey wait a minute i know that guy' actors and you've got yourself one great set of stars the characters themselves however lack three dimensionality and more often than not come across as very stereotypical we've got a black oculist a hard as nails prison warden a human rights activist woman and plenty of other stock characters but in all honesty this 'fault' actually aids the film instead of boring character development in an over long equilibrium we are chucked more or less straight into the action and once it gets going very early on there's not a single scene that's a filler it's balls to the wall plot unlike a certain shawshank redemption frank darabont 1994 sharing conventions with the slasher genre this is somewhat of a convention itself and in good ol' slasher genre tradition prison punishes those who have been bad all in all this is an excellent little horror film and one which is sadly overlooked and unmentioned among the horror world with an excellent cast and great special effects and rather original death scenes this film is highly recommended to horror fans don't be fooled into thinking it'll be a cheesy little film either just because it was made in usa 1980s it's far from cheesy although the very end does ruin this and simultaneously far from gritty and realistic whilst it attempts to tackle issues such as prison rape these are rather subtly done i give it 3 5 out of 5 luvs a very entertaining horror film with some very nice touches indeed	positive
raising victor vargas is a movie you definitely need to see it was very heart felt and had a lot of humor that gets you sucked right in it is so much like real life with what teenagers have to go through victor a cocky teen but with a good heart at the end deals with love in all the right places dealing with girls and family at the end victor learns the true meaning of love after dealing with a old fashioned grandmother and a girl who he wants to use is actually using him too i recommend people to watch this movie because it will be like you are watching a real family thats how much feeling this movie has one heart felt moment was when victor's grandmother throws victor out over something simple victor was really heart and couldn't believe that she would do something like that it made me feel real sorry for him like it was real overall i give this movie a b	positive
seriously i don t really get why people here are bashing it i mean the idea of a killer snowman wreaking havoc on a tropical island paradise is pretty absurd the good news is the producers realized it and made it a comedy in the vein of army of darkness especially in the second half of the film when the little killer snowballs attack i laughed my ass off for example the put one of the little creeps into a blender a la gremlins 1 and mix it after that it morphs back into a snowball and squeals with a high pitched voice that was fun bottom line incredible movie rent it	positive
gung ho is one of those movies that i never get tired of watching michael keaton has always been a favorite of mine he is absolutely hilarious in this movie matching him step for step is gedde watanabe the two of them work wonderfully together although this movie is a comedy i also like how it shows hunt keaton kazihiro watanabe struggling in their roles as the leaders of their respective groups they both try so hard to keep the peace then they finally get into a fight which is hysterical to watch first they're both on the floor then hunt jumps on a chair kazihiro jumps on the desk hunt jumps on the desk with him the fight then spills out from the office into the factory i love that after they are separated by the workers you can tell that they both feel bad for letting things get so out of hand also there is a scene where you can see the influence that hunt has had on kazihiro he is at his house his boss from japan arrives says he would like to visit the factory tomorrow kazihiro tomorrow not good day sakamoto why not kazihiro factory is locked we can't find key tell me you can't picture michael keaton saying something like that i guess i really like this movie because it is genuinely funny also shows how people that are radically different can not only learn from each other but become good friends as well	positive
my dog recently passed away and this was a movie i loved as a kid so i had to see it to try to cheer up beware of dog i mean spoilers this movie isn't just for kids and it's far from ordinary it was set in new orleans in 1939 first and foremost the dog was not portrayed as an extra family member in this film but as an adult with his own complicated life to deal with in the beginning charlie is not too different from his dishonest and brutal business partner carface he is money driven greedy and just escaped death row as he states in the start of the feature the difference between charlie and carface is that charlie can learn and is willing to listen to others anne marie and his sidekick itchy carface will not even listen to the fat ugly dog with the big glasses who happens to be closest to him carface attempts to murder the hero because he wants 100 of the profits in their business and won't settle for only 50 a highly unusual way for a german shepherd mix to die also being eaten by a prehistoric sized alligator who ends up sparing your life because you can sing is highly unlikely whether you are a dog or not this is a cartoon and that's why it is logical here carface's method of revenge is through murder while charlie believes success is the best revenge financial success that is after surviving death he starts a business by taking carface's source of financing a highly talented girl who possesses the ability to communicate with animals they win a whole bunch of races and charlie tells her he'll give the money to the poor hint hint charlie and itchy live in a junkyard and are therefore poor he uses the money toward his casino bar theatre and not the other poor the reason why anne marie has the ability to talk to animals is that she has compassion and she listens carefully she teaches charlie ethics by pointing out his gambling lying and stealing charlie tries to make up for it by buying her dresses she added the ethics that his business needed while charlie did management and itchy provided construction carface uses violence and property damage to tear down charlie's business which is unprotected by the government charlie loses everything and all he has left is this little girl in the end he had to choose between her life and his own he first grabs the watch out of self preservation and sets it down when the girl started to sink both the girl and the watch were sinking and he had to choose which one and he chose the girl the great part about this movie that focuses on a person's ability to learn right from wrong over time and a child's ability to cope with the natural occurrence of death of their pet is that it never shows anyone dying the watch symbolizes his life and the watch is shown being submerged and stopped all the deaths were suggestive even for the villain i didn't cry during this movie until now and i have gotten so much more out of it that i had to write it down and share it with you	positive
i've written at least a half dozen scathing reviews of this abysmal little flick and none get published so i must opine that someone at imdb com really likes this awful movie the idea that a bunch of oilmen can resurrect a military tank that has set in the desert for over a decade and make a fighting machine of it again is ludicrous so is the acting and direction pass on it	negative
you can't watch a film like peter watkins' privilege a story of the exploitation of a pop music performer by big business the state and even organized religion without thinking of creatively degenerate commodities like michael jackson or britney spears who hawk corporate giants like pepsi or some other poison for money or any number of entertainers in music or movies who become tools of political parties or commercial religious interests like scientology and kabbalah a film like privilege must have seemed almost like science fiction when released in 1967 so fantastic was its premise today we tend to take celebrity endorsements for granted giving little thought to its more alarming implications watkins' vision has not only become reality we tacitly accept this reality as normal now consider punishment park as privilege challenges the viewer to examine what is being sold to us and why punishment park demands that we reckon with what is being taken from us and why heaven help america and for that matter the world if contemporary politicians get their hands on this film it is already so close to reality that in viewing it recently i experienced a genuine nauseating feeling of anxiety watkins again skillfully employs a documentary style narrative whereas in privilege some rough edges to this technique were apparent in punishment park it has been honed to sharp seamless perfection the sense of realism is enhanced by disarmingly unpretentious economical believable portrayals by the entire cast this is the kind of acting hollywood has completely turned its back on to its detriment in favor of cosmetically perfect image projections the cast has first rate material to work with in watkins' screenplay many cinematic visionaries have tried to shake the viewer out of their complacent false sense of security no one has ever achieved this result with such stark and chilling accuracy as peter watkins does here what seems quite clear now is that instead of trying to bring the estranged and excluded americans such as these people back into the national community the administration has chosen to accept and exploit the present division within the country and to side with what it considers is the majority instead of the politics of reconciliation it has chosen the politics of polarization to paraphrase one of the characters we don't have to call them pigs because they know what they are better than we do	positive
this movie starts out with a certain amount of promise but in my view begins to lose it when the protagonist kidnaps the good samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down that this well meaning stranger begins to fix his car while he is away making a phone call is implausible enough but that she is one of the few people in the country who can help him put his family's life back on track is the type of coincidence beginning writers are warned against using in their stories i found this movie average at best art direction could have been much better as could have been cinematography the acting was good and so was eva van der gucht's singing	negative
the lady in cement is a veritable course on social anthropology of the late 60's the writing not the acting is at center stage did i say pure camp prepare to be offended if you are female or gay broad and dame are standard terms and gay baiting and bashing are represented for what they were in the day camp wise most of the lines are tossed off although there are wonderful performances by a very few outstanding character actors the action scenes are mundane but it is fun to see dan blocker play a tough guy who likes bashing toughs and lanie kazan and racquel welsh are at the voluptuous peak of their careers amazing to note they were both 28 years old and mr sinatra was 53 the musical score wait was there a score well you get the point watch it with friends who want a good laugh it's full of them	negative
i totally disagree with the comments of one of the critics before me who bashed the film having read the book being impressed by it although this is a kind of literature that you cannot really like similar to hubert selby's writing i expected being shocked but the effect was more subtle than this isabelle hubert is a brilliant actress who manages to convey a multi layered character there are many scenes that totally focus on her and her subtle changes and i can imagine few actresses who would do so well with so much disregard for their own reputation or image there is this coldness distance cruelty and at the same time there's this helplessness hurt and pain there's a person who's in control and controlled at the same time maybe this is not realistic although when you read the newspaper you'll read about much worse than this but there's a truth to it that is very difficult to bear i think it's an excellent film but i did not enjoy watching it it's not boring but there are times when i wished it would end btw her male counterpart is very well acted as well and i think well chosen too	positive
i would have to say that in general barbie movies have impressed me i have a 5 year old barbie fanatic niece and she watches them all the time so needless to say i have seen quite a lot of barbie these holidays but i am not sick of them this film visually has a lot to offer especially the backgrounds and the animation of the characters has improved with each new movie one thing i noticed in particular was a vast improvement in the animation of barbie's hair in this film it has a lovely range of excerpts from classical music and i think that this is great as it exposes a new generation to the classics this film is well worth ago especially if you have young relievers they will be entertained for hours	positive
i highly reccommend this movie it blurs the line between childhood fantasy and everyday reality in such a seamless fashion that it has to be seen to be believed the actors and director have such perfect timing that in one scene a name calling fight becomes a sort of dance i loved the story line the actors everything while i do think there were one or two decidedly cheesy scenes over all the movie was impeccably done	positive
i have watched the root of all evil with the avowed object of refuting this so called scientific atheist i don't know where to start as he is such a rich source of stupidity he is obviously not a statistician else the odds of 2 1 of him burning for all eternity would have pushed him towards belief in god he regards science as religion and expects us to believe him as we do god one has only to look at the language used in his postulations regarding faith this commodity is used extensively in everyday behaviour just think about it when he gets in an electrician be believes that it will be wired correctly and trustfully turns on the switch when he gets in a plumber he pulls the chain in his bathroom and expects the water to flow in the right direction regarding faith in science when i was in chemistry class i believed and was taught that the atom was the smallest particle and the onion skin theory of electrons both of which have now been discounted i was taught this as the atomic theory 'writ in stone' so to speak so why should we believe any scientist especially when he goes beyond the parameters of his field dawkins states that religion will be the downfall of civilisation religion is civilisation can he or any other atheist please tell us what civilisation was founded and nurtured by atheism barbarism or savagery please he is now living in the last stages of a christian based civilisation and taking all the benefits from it without any admission for its source i found dawkins to be arrogant dictatorial judgmental an obvious believer in eugenics and a nazi in his attitude towards the young how dare he say what a parent can teach their child the child is theirs not the nation's and as the parents bequeath to it their genetics so do they bequeath their beliefs his dismissal of adam as he never existed as he has no proof was an example of this same attitude so i have no proof that joe blogs lives in new york but he well may do i just haven't found the proof yet that does not negate his existence i note his argument with the bishop of oxford that the prelate is selective with what he takes and believes in the bible well dawkins also does this where does he draw the line between it as a historical document and a religious statement he is also selective i heard the lot when dawkins came up with the altruistic gene what a hoot he is desperately looking for proof for his wackiness and as the piltdown man was invented so now we have this so called altruistic gene which predisposes us to looking after our young and other members of our 'group' the trouble is that all animals do this not just apes and with evolution it is survival of the fittest not the kindest and if he really thinks we are becoming kinder as a race he is not reading the same newspapers as i am i found his arrogance beyond belief in declaiming that as we only have this life we should enjoy it to the full so how does he equate this with his obvious position as a well off european to a destitute person in africa who has had all her family wiped out and probably raped and is starving will he help her i note that all his opposition to religion is a that they go to war well g k chesterton declared that the only war worth fighting was a war for religion b we are against using contraception and abortion and homosexuality all sins against the 6th commandment funny that as a catholic i find his dismissal of pius xii's pronouncement of the dogma of the assumption in 1958 to be erroneous he pius never said that it was revealed to him while he was sitting somewhere by himself in case dawkins does not know it revelation ended with the last apostle pius would have taken years of advice and studied documents handed from down over the centuries to have come up with this pronouncement also as a catholic i find his dismissal of all religious people as satisfied what utter rubbish we everyday fight the world the flesh and the devil we are the church militant we are also able to glory at a sunset and admire the beauties of nature even if we believe in god the trouble with dawkins was that he interviewed whacky zealots and extrapolated them to all of us	negative
in today's world of digital fabrication there is no computer than can replace the actor and writer alas this type of character driven film is far too rare these days duvall's performance as well as james earl jones are faithful to their audience's high expectations i wonder if this movie was made for tv it has a close up personal quality to the narrative it is an understatement to say that the performances are all outstanding the only thing that keeps it from being a cinema masterpiece is the lack of a great cinematographer but pretty pictures are not everything how can talent the likes of jones and duvall continue to produce such fine work in an age where actors pose for the digitizing	positive
i recently rented this film on dvd and thought it would be an interesting choice seeing as i am both from the north of england bradford and also interested in film making however it soon became apparent that this film seemed to lack a decent level of development script wise the characters were weak and often stereotyped and the story lacked substance the subject matter could be an interesting basis for a film however the delivery of this appeared naive and unfocused the ending felt as though it was casting judgement on the characters punishing and rewarding where the filmmakers felt necessary this felt a little awkward and silly and seemed at odds with the 'realism' used in the style of shooting for me the film dealt with the characters and subject matter in a rather heavy handed and clumsy manner it felt as though the writer had already decided how he wanted to end the story and set about crow barring everything else in to fit it another point that i feel strongly about is the watered down ken loach feel the film had i get quite upset that uk film financiers can't see that there is more to british films than 'gritty realism' it has become almost a safe option film is an infinitely wonderful playground for imaginative ideas and it is not being exploited by uk feature film producers there is a lot of talent here in the uk it's unfortunate that most of these individuals end up either making music videos and commercials 100 of the time or they go to america love hate would have worked better if it had been cut down to 30 or 60 minutes and appeared as a one off tv drama	negative
one of the more obscure of anthony mann's westerns the last frontier was also his only cavalry western aside from one brief episode in winchester '73 though naturally he focuses on the outsiders and internal conflicts rather than offering a fordian celebration of comradeship and shared ideals set not in his beloved high country but in the foothills and forests it's a much more cynical view of life of the frontier in many ways his fort apache without the need to preserve the legend this outpost is made up of misfits failures cowards and the odd competent officer ignored by his superiors badly led while the civil war takes priority and all the best the army has to offer victor mature and james whitmore are the free trappers who find civilisation creeping up on them when they are relieved of their pelts and packhorses by a local tribe aggrieved by the incursion of the cavalry into their territory rather than blame the indians for their losses they decide it's the army's fault for building the fort and decide to demand compensation from them ending up joining their ranks as scouts instead but despite the best efforts of guy madison's amiable and competent acting commander to bring mature into the 19th century and make him fit to wear the uniform the arrival of robert preston's humiliated colonel eager to revenge himself on the tribe that drove him out of his own outpost and mature's clumsy infatuation with the colonel's wife anne bancroft too much of a blank slate here to do much with the role of a woman who's tired of being saved by men who think they know what's best for her soon drive matters into much darker territory it's not long before some of the soldiers are busily planning on killing each other both sides trying to goad their subordinates into doing the deed for them little wonder that at one point mature throws away the bluecoat he has long coveted in disgust screaming i would have died for this but it's nothing but a dirty filthy blue rag the stallone of his day mature was one of those actors who could surprise you with the odd excellent performance here and there when matched with the right part and the right director this is not one of his better days despite having his most complex part perversely enough as a simple man well meaning but drunk violent uneducated and with a unsubtle almost childlike lust for life the part seems designed with burt lancaster in mind with some striking similarities to his character in the kentuckian but robert preston's ahab like colonel is clearly the best role determined to resurrect the career he destroyed in a single disastrously suicidal civil war engagement by launching another pointless suicidal campaign against the tribe that added another humiliation to the list that keeps him out of sight and out of mind of the promotion board in his obsession to redeem his career he moves further away from any hope of moral redemption driven as much by his sense of shame at his wife's sympathy as by the promotion of former comrades he regards as his inferiors he's beyond salvation but there's still a recognisable human being in there and one not entirely without a sense of integrity he genuinely admires madison's courage in making a futile attempt to get preston's orders countermanded by their superiors fatally skewed though it is like its hero the film is a little rough around the edges and boasts one of the most surreal and jaunty title songs of any western but that only tends to make it more interesting and there are plenty of mann's typically elegant camera moves and plays on perspective while the frontier setting is convincingly harsh and primitive unfortunately the deficiencies of the early cinemascope lenses are very apparent in columbia's dvd with the image often dark 2 55 1 cinemascope required a huge amount of additional lighting and early scope films show a lot of trial and error and grainy	positive
this is a painfully slow story about the last days of 1999 when a strange disease breaks out and i stopped caring this is suppose to be about two people who live over or under each other in an apartment complex there's a leak and a plumber put a hole in the man's floor so you can see into the woman's below apartment also since there is a crisis going on much of the dialog is actually news reports sounds promising not really i became distracted and started doing other things which is deadly in a subtitled film basically i started not watching which made events seem even more surreal when i did look up it may work for you it didn't for me	negative
this is a really fun movie one of those you can sit and mindlessly watch as the plot gets more and more twisted more and more funny sally field teri hatcher in her hey day kevin klein elisabeth shue robert downey jr it's all these well known quality actors acting as if they are soap opera stars producers if you have ever watched a soap opera and thought how on earth did they come up with this idea you will love this movie i have seen it multiple times and each time i watch it the more i appreciate the humor the more i realize just how well acted it really is don't expect oscar quality this is a fun movie to entertain not some artsy attempt at finding man's inner man etc sit back relax and laugh	positive
you can often tell a movie didn't turn out like it should by the heavy use of a narrator this film features this device throughout richard jobson not entirely content to write direct and even fund some of this film adds to his credits by reading excerpts of his own semi autobiographical writing which combined with some pretty editing manages to gloss over what is a dull depressing tale which he must be mistaking for genuine art house kevin mckidd puts in a good performance everyone else is okay budget constraints meant that all scenes are shot in daylight though most are obviously meant to be at night though if you know serious alcoholics they mainly operate in the day so for me it adds a touch of realism the funniest part of this film is a waitress who fails to age a single day in the 20 odd years that elapse between her appearances a more extreme version of the problem mckidd has who goes from 18 to 30 without changing more than his clothes bless	negative
didn't really know what to expect from this movie and found myself being pleasantly surprised i picked it up because i recently stumbled across norman reedus and am trying to find more of the films that he's been in i'm not big into hustler movies or con movies but i have to say this one roped me in within minutes probably because i couldn't quit figure out exactly who was hustling who this movie is stylish and fast paced with a story that is believable thanks to location and fantastic performances while i was impressed with most in the film i must say dagmara dominczyk was simply excellent give it a chance it's a really fun film	positive
pretty decent for his early work and no kokaku kidotai without it and gets an 2 points extra for the easter eggs for shirow definitely a rung in the ladder i am biased as a shirow fan but this was a big step from dirty pair which was what i knew of him violent fun with a porno soundtrack you cannot help but notice that i know people appreciate him for ghost in the shell but all of the deep spiritual overtones were dealt with in appleseed eswat killing terrorists the struggle for humans to stay viable as bioroids phase them out and deunan staying thin despite her intake of junk food definitely like the characters even the traitor and i do not know why	positive
my synopsis rae christina ricci was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with ronnie justin timberlake to fulfill her needs ronnie must report to his national guard unit and leaves rae all alone rae is not alone for long because she is the town tramp with a powerful need to hook up with a man after a party rae is taken home by a friend who ends up beating her half to death and throws her on the side of the road the next day lazarus samuel l jackson finds rae and carries her home lazarus gives medical care to rae and believes that he can also save her from herself rae is like a dog in heat so lazarus puts a 40 pound chain around her and his radiator to keep her from going out looking for men lazarus has problems of his own because his wife has just left him for another man lazarus turns to his blues music to relieve his pain my comment the movie has a deep meaning to it once you get past the sex and violence the film has a different feel to it the story is raw and almost puts you in the movie as if you were there the 40 pound chain is a good metaphor and symbolic of a chastity belt you don't give love away to anyone but you keep it for your true love the chain could also be a parallel to a wife who is chained to the kitchen yet rae didn't cook rae only wanted to have sex all the time whereas a wife may not i think craig brewer writer director has made an extraordinary movie and samuel l jackson sings a mean blues song the story is emotionally charged tackling the subjects of race religion music and sex all into one paramount classics run time 1 56 rated r 8 10	positive
one would have expected hitchcock's return to major studio filmmaking to err on the side of chastened caution surely few expected his most riotous unrestrained film a gleeful melange of vicious black comedy exciting suspense mocking manipulation and astonishing flights of fancy but that is precisely what they got strangers on a train what is remarkable is how much bruno's transgression disrupts the world of the film much has been made of the masterly crosscutting motif but its immediate effect is to completely obstruct the straight line of progress guy is making of his life and hence the society he represents or is eager to join guy is the archetypal american the working class boy made good moving in influential circles athletic successful handsome bruno is his destructive opposite gay decadent 'european' he lives off his father in a big house and just lounges about dreaming of murder bruno's life is one of repetition circularity whereas guy moves straight ahead it is bruno's achievement to move guy into his realm represented by the merry go round and force him to transgress break the law hope for murder bruno's bruno is quite literally fighting patriarchy all the authority figures in the film are criticised bruno's father a man whose brutality we get a glimpse of but the true horror of which is constantly alluded to in the film especially in aunt clara's paintings that incredibly intense negative energy must come from somewhere anna's incredibly machiavellian self serving father the insensitive judge who thinks nothing of lunching after an execution the tennis commentator whose smugly authorative comments are always mistaken far from being the mother hater of legend hitch as robin wood perceived is deeply hostile to fathers and patriarchy bruno's transgression turns the world topsy turvy this is hitch's most surreal film whenever guy is in his plot he is filmed straight with conventionally romantic music but whenever bruno intrudes the atmosphere becomes carnivalesque bizarre much more fun this is hitch's first truly american film revelling in the primitive detritus of americana grown men puncture little boys' balloons or try to throw them off merry go rounds distinguished professors of mathematics sing about goats on trains elderly society matrons are strangled at elegant soirees washington is filmed like a series of spare lines in a vast desert under a huge sky like a haunting dali painting there is one of the greatest and funniest scenes in all cinema when we see a motionless smiling bruno in a sea of turning heads at a tennis match an image worthy of magritte just look at any scene with bruno in it and watch it derail into the bizarre phalluses abound in the most ridiculous permutations check all those balloons hitch had obviously just seen the third man as well as in more staid environs washington will never look the same again strangers is also vertigo notwithstanding hitch's most overtly sexual film as well as the phalluses there is the sustained homoeroticism the remarkable play with 'riding' horses the gobsmacking fellatio joke when hitch's daughter spills powder over the policeman and yet hitch doesn't stint on good old suspense in the very proper endeavour to show what a great artist he was critics tend to overlook what made him famous in the first place much has been made of bruno as a prototype of norman bates and hitch plays merry havoc on audience identification willing bruno into murder there is a hilariously painful sequence where bruno loses the lighter with which he intends to frame guy down a drain the gasps of tension and sighs of relief on the part of the audience i was a part of in support of an insane murderer is inherently funny slightly disturbing and highly revealing about our true reactions to conformity and success and hitch milks it with callous glee listen to the mocking music and exagerrated compositions and kick yourself for taking it all so seriously strangers is one of hitch's five best films and therefore one of the greatest things in cinema the dialogue is so strange and brilliant i can't believe it wasn't written by chandler patricia hitchcock is a wonderful imp standing in for her cheeky father as she taunts guy the fairground finale is a remarkable dizzying fusion of exciting tense set piece black comedy and symbolic site if bruno's final words condemn him to hell according to the catholic precepts hitch is supposed to embody compare with a similar ending in the killers we applaud his integrity infinitely preferable to guy's debased serving of self	positive
its no surprise that busey later developed a tumor in his sinus cavity this film is also a poor decision but one i enjoyed fully the first 5 minutes is the most uninspiring 5 minutes in any film boring bad dialouge and then with a spiderman stance busey yells the best worst line in any film ever created your worst nightmare butthorn i coughed up some of my egg nog laughing so hard that line resonates so well it even tops clooney's infamous hi freeze i'm batman line other classic moments is busey constantly getting upset for people reminding him that he got his ex cia partner killed which he did by accidentally shooting him in the chest all made possible by a super slow motion flashback sequence that makes watching paint dry seem exciting there's an ashtray to the nads punches to the face and a that wasn't my fault and you know it well the footage shows him missing the bad guy and hitting his buddy so other scream out loud moments has to be his ex girl friend dropping a grenade to the ground to enable his escape a plan that defies all logic physics and absurdity and lastly when mcbain jumps out of the thunderblast during intense guerrilla warfare and starts to run and hurdles a small object i almost wet myself some of busey's best work by far rent or buy it today butthorn my vote is a perfect 10 on the poo meter that is	positive
it might not be the best movie of 2006 but it was a just a movie to excite and to think about the sentinel is a good political thriller movie which seems similar to or even borrows some elements from other political thriller movies such as in the line of fire and the manchurian candidate the basic plot of this movie is similar to other movies like this a plot to kill the president of the united states michael douglas stars as secret service agent pete garrison who spearheads the operation only to find out later that he has been framed kiefer sutherland co stars as a sort of rival by the name of david breckinridge and eva longoria as jill marin who is a rookie agent going under the guidance of agent breckinridge and academy award winner kim basinger as first lady sarah ballentine one improvement for this movie could have been more action as it is by some sources considered just as much an action film as is a thriller film but a good thing about this movie is instead of just an assassination plot to kill the us president it also concerns a mole traitor in the secret service who is leading the president in the wrong direction	positive
quirky vulnerable raw honest and a treat to watch i'm not here to give a summary or synopsis of the film i simply wish to congratulate this small film with the great big heart i tip my hat to the filmmaker and it's excellent cast if you want to know what happens in the film then go see it michael parness writer director has handled a very sensitive and emotional subject matter suicide with great compassion comedy and empathy i see a great career ahead for mr parness this film works right from the outrageous opening sequence to the tender honest moments between david krumholtz and natasha lyonne as with every movie we need to suspend some disbelief yet i found with max and grace i was easily transported and completely convinced with it's surreal moments i only wish they would have pushed some of those moments even further mr parness has pulled some wonderful performances from this already talented cast for instance guillermo díaz' performance as a patient in the asylum was hysterical as well as moving the colossus ralf moeller former mr olympiad as a terrified patient perfect i can go on and on this independent feature has the star power of a big budget hollywood film however you forget about the stars on screen as you flow along with this wonderfully written story the real star here is the brilliant screenplay i look forward to seeing more from writer director michael parness	positive

once again proving his amazing versatility john turturro plays the introspective russian chess genius preparing for a comeback tournament and forging an unlikely relationship with a gadabout fellow resident emily watson at a 1920's italian hotel they fall in love to the horror of her social mountaineering mother geraldine james a wonderful love story whose gloss of chess might make it appear cerebral but in spite of its origins in a nabakov story it certainly is not the romantic elements and the sense of time and place beat the psychological analysis hands down john turturro having appeared in barton fink o brother where art thou the big lebowski proves that he is not dependant on coen bros films to assert his stature	positive
every time you think you have a handle on deathtrap another plot twist comes along best to just sit back and enjoy the ride on this one most noted for its on screen kiss between michael caine and christopher reeve which was unfortunately cut from the televised version i saw this movie has a great deal more to recommend it sidney bruhl michael caine is a very unhappy man once a successful playwright his last several plays on broadway have flopped and while his wife myra dyan cannon is nothing but supportive in both the monetary and emotional sense this does little to make sidney feel any better to add insult to injury young playwright clifford anderson christopher reeve has just sent sidney a play to look at it's anderson's first and sidney can see that the young man is a gifted writer he jokes to his wife that he should invite anderson over kill him and submit the play as his own she laughs with him at first but when sidney actually invites anderson over for dinner she worries that he may really be putting his scheme into action and her fears just may be justified it's a brilliant script there are twists and turns all through the plot and they come faster and more furious as you get closer to the end it's the kind of film that has you on the edge of your seat from the beginning and keeps you there the entire time an absolute masterpiece of suspense and mystery the acting is excellent caine gives his usual excellent performance and he does exhibit a knack for playing cultured refined and intellectual men reeve also gives an excellent rendering of a man who isn't nearly as wide eyed or innocent as he seems cannon's franticness works well for myra and irene worth gives a nice performance as a nosy neighbor who is also a psychic this is a film with an ending you'd never expect and repeated watchings help to pick up on things missed in earlier viewings an unsung classic that is unfortunately only remembered for a scene which ruffled some sensibilities at the time and that is a real shame	positive
steven seagal movies have never been oscar material but with each passing release they get worse and worse this one starts with seagal getting picked up by the fbi because he killed a few people 'in self defence' he's active military so is saved from jail to rescue a stolen stealth plane that will be used by the cliché 'evil english villain' that hollywood is so obsessed with including these days suffice to say the film has terrible dialog that is almost always delivered with a hefty topping of cheese and lack of acting talent the story isn't interesting and there are segments of it which make absolutely no sense and do not add anything to the story characters of movie as a whole such as the 'lesbian' interaction between the two main females in the cast which is there purely for titilation to get viewers and yet isn't even titilating just confusing as it makes no sense as to why it happened when it didn't need to in short a terrible script with bad dialog delivered by sub par actors boring and at times badly choreographed action scenes and non relevant parts that only serve to achieve the near impossible and make the movie even worse save 98 minutes of your life and give this miss even if you are seagal's most ardent fan	negative
this movie is hilarious i watched it with my friend and we just had to see it again this movie is not for you movie goers who will only watch the films that are nominated for academy awards you know who you are i won't recap it because you have seen that from all the other reviews whipped is a light hearted comedy that had me laughing throughout it doesn't take itself too seriously and should be watched with your friends not your girlfriend it won't win any awards but it just has to be watched to be appreciated true some of the jokes are toilet humor but that is not necessarily a bad thing everyone can use some of it sometimes some people need to lighten up and see whipped for what it is not what it isn't 1 4 out of	positive
as other reviews have said another of the countless number of alien clones this time with a great wodge of the terminator thrown in add a bit of the classic sf story who goes there and a insanely stupid plot device lifted from the andromeda strain apparently flashing red lights make rampaging killer 'droids unable to detect scared people standing three inches away from them ok the story after a sequence of people running around in a space ship and killing each other we get a caption 25 years later the crew of a relay station orbiting mars due to be relieved in 48 hours detect a ginormous space ship on a collision course it's the siberia the ship we saw in the opening sequence not a good time to have taken everything useful off line on the relay station to do some repairs then the approaching ship doesn't deviate from its course and is broadcasting a do not under any circumstances enter this ship warning after a lot of shouting at each other the crew of the relay station patch something together and get the station out of the way just in the nick of time but the ship changes course and rams them any way impaling one of the crew on a stick outy pointy crew impaler thing the satellite starts to loose integrity bits de pressurise lots more shouting and running about in which only two crew people are sucked out into space backwards why are they always sucked out backwards after a few keystrokes the wheelchair bound techy who is called 'wheeler' the only only detectable joke in the whole movie deduces that the siberia is draining them of all their power and they need to go aboard her and switch off its engines they all go on board and take their helmets off do not enter this ship obviously means get on board the ship and expose yourself to possibly fatal infectious diseases one team head for the main computer room where they find a dead frozen guy clutching what looks like an american express card but turns out to be a minidisc the other team find some switches amazingly the dead bloke turns out to be the father of the attractive female crew member voted most likely to survive an encounter with a rampaging alien they switch the engines off but this means the ships reactor will explode a spooky point of view shot starts killing people there's some guff about the siberia having discovered an new ore a petential power source worth millions which mean the more venal members of the crew immediately thrust themselves into danger to get hold of it the pov shot returns with whoosh whoosh walking noises on the soundtrack unfortunately these give you the idea the killer is wearing corduroy trousers and the effect is wasted after that it's all just running around and getting killed in order of ugliness and acting ability until only the obvious survivors survive along with the cute dog which had managed to lead at least two crew members to their deaths just why space hardened veterans wander into the jaws of certain death looking for their pets cats and dogs has long been a mystery of this kind of movie other stupid highlights include everyone forgetting to act the falling levels of oxygen until reminded by the voice of the on board computer not that the low levels of oxygen in any way dampen any of the impressive fires this load of idiots start if the killer droid id so clever it can steer the ship in a tight curve and have another go at ramming the relay station why didn't it turn off the do not under any circumstances enter this ship warning signal i'm sure if it was looking for more people to kill then yelling go away was not a good way of going about it musetta vander is the only person who gets to do any acting everyone else just flares their nostrils all the time while baring their teeth and shouting and pointing guns at each other it that sort of script full of exclamation marks the only thing that kept me watching till the end was the hope that the script demand she take all her clothes off or get wet while not wearing a lot unfortunately it didn't one of the things wrong with this movie apart from it having more cyan put on screen than in any other movie ever is that there was no gratuitous nudity	negative
if the directors producers publicists wish to promote a film as based on actual events and make a film that is meant to inspire and have meaning then for a start to maintain any sort of creditability and integrity you would want to keep a film as honest as you possibly can a team wearing all black jumpers and doing the haka in america is just plain dumb any half intelligent person would know that the all blacks are the national rugby union team of new zealand and their jumpers are all black and the haka is performed by them as a part of a traditional maori dance having such stupidity in a movie without explanation merely reduces the credibility of the movie to zero and negates the message and inspiration that the movie is trying to achieve the question is why why would you do such a stupid thing and for what possible gain i can only conclude that the writers or director or producers have seen it on tv before a international rugby union match and thought wow that would be great in our movie no one will know that it never happened they're all too dumb to know about nz nd the all blacks this will be great how would an americian audience react to a movie made in nz about americain grid iron with a team wearing an american indian costumes and war paint doing a native american indian war dance running round in circles shouting oh woo woo woo oh woo woo woo react they'd laugh their heads off the people that made this movie and the industry that spawned it really should have their heads read for some reason the industry thinks that they can fool all the people all the time it's just dumb	negative

spoilers i was very disappointed in love's abiding joy i had been waiting a really long time to see it and i finally got the chance when it re aired thursday night on hallmark i love the first three love movies but this one was nothing like i thought it was going to be the whole movie was sad and depressing there were way to many goofs and the editing was very poor to many scenes out of context i also think the death of baby kathy happened way to soon and clarks appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit it seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there they were all lacking emotion there seemed to be no interaction between missie and willie at all i think the script writers should have went more by the book it seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from janette oke's writings i mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or clark getting hurt because of it and i think missie and willies reactions to kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard out of the four movies that have been made so far i'd have to say that love's abiding joy is my least favorite i hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if clarks character is in them i hope he's got a bigger part and i hope his part isn't so bland i also hope there is more of scottie and cookie and maybe even marty but who knows what the script writers will have in store next	negative
this movie is pretty good half a year ago i bought it on dvd but first i thought that it was the original film i have seen the series and it is a good film but here they have put the living legend part1 and 2 and fire in space together the same as they did with the first film but with other episodes but still it is a pretty good film only the ending is strange you don't see what happens with the pegasus but i still think that it is pretty good the actors and special effects were good if you haven't seen it go see it starring richard hatch dirk benedict lorne greene herb jefferson jr tony swartz terry carter lloyd bridges jack stauffer	positive
this movie is not as horrible as most sci fi channel movies i am used to seeing the gray cgi blobs and the amateurish special effects such as close ups of fake blood that make it very obvious that the blood is strawberry syrup or some other syrup variation however i had thought that i had seen all the possible lows that the sci fi channel could hit then i saw this movie imagine a hand inside a rubberized sock that is glazed with syrup those are the main alien vampires in this movie you can clearly see the fingers inside the rubbery sock puppets a talking hand comes out of the guts of victims and the vampire who is on the vampire hunter's team can talk to these rubber sock puppets in transylvanian how did alien vampires learn transylvanian and isn't transylvania in romania so shouldn't they be talking romanian why would some little town have their own language if you can suspend your gag reflex and get past the talking rubber socks with the fingers clearly moving inside the aliens' heads then you have to deal with the other alien vampires there are the leatherfaces who like to wear the faces of their victims then there are the just plain ugly ones that all seem to have a lot of facial scars then there are the annoying valley girls and their boyfriends who are human traitors and sneak into space colonies so that they can sabotage the defense systems so that these space vampires can attack finally if you think all of the above is funny and worth a laugh you have to deal with the third rate cast of network tv rejects that make up this team of stereotypical angry heroes which are constantly fighting among themselves why does almost every sci fi channel movie have to use lead characters that are annoying abrasive crude or just totally unsympathetic i found myself hoping the talking rubber socks would win	negative
there is no possible reason i can fathom why this movie was ever made why must hollywood continue to crank out one horrible update of a classic after another cases in point mister magoo the avengers awful christopher lloyd whom i normally enjoy was so miserably miscast in this role his manic portrayal of our beloved uncle martin is so unspeakably unenjoyable to be almost criminal his ranting groaning grimacing and histrionics provide us with no reason to care for his character except as some 1 dimensional cartoon character the director must have thought that fast movements screaming dialogue and one take slapstick had some similarity to comedy apparently he told every actor to act as if they had red ants in their pants fault must lie with the irresponsibly wrought script i think the writer used it's a mad mad mad mad world as an example of a fine comedy script as manic as that 1963 classic is it is far superior to this claptrap in fact suddenly it looks pretty good in comparison what is most sad about this movie is that it must have apparently been written to appeal to young children i just am not sure whose children it was made for certainly no self respecting card carrying child i know if they had to remake my favorite martian why didn't they add some of the timeless charm of the original classic unfortunately imdb com cannot factor in zero as a rating for its readers that is the only rating that comes to mind in describing this travesty one good thing did come from this movie the actors and crew were paid i think	negative
the script was very weak w o enough character arcs to make you care one bit about the characters or what happens to them the script is way too talky and not enough gore or action to even call it slow paced the story gets to the point that you just want everyone to shut up and die as quickly as possible so you don't have to listen to them talk this very muted stiff dialogue on a technical note the music mix is way to high and makes it hard to understand what is being said most times then again this could be called a blessing overall this same story could have better been told in a short film w a running time under 30 minutes the obvious in your face homages to sam raimi and evil dead would have been good had they been more subtle but here they seem more like a bald faced rip off c'mon this kind of 35mm budget and this is the best that could be done still the cinematography lighting design and shots were very well done indeed	negative
i would recommend this as the most successful attempt so far to make a movie on soviet afghan war and it is very honest and responsible picture starting from small details of uniforms and weapons up to human relations war routine and central asian landscapes it's been shot in tajikistan just after the the troop withdrawal which happened in 1989 not in 1985 the italian star mr placido was just perfect in the role of major bandura other characters looked also very natural especially always drunk club managing officer the scenario seems a bit jammed in the end but it might be an impact of the civil war in tajikistan which had started right during the shooting of the film all movie team had to escape sometimes even under fire the last scene is purely harakiri type of behavior and reminded me the final phrase from one famous samurai movie we've won all battles but lost the war it could be also a metaphor of ussr collapse the great country allowing to shoot itself to the back by the small offended child	positive
christopher lee is one of my favorite actors i'm trying to view all of his work he has been known to single handedly save movies with his presence unfortunately this is not one of them this movie suffers from a low budget and it's production values are disturbing please for the love of christopher avoid this film	negative
no spoilers just plot details i can't understand such hatred for this episode you want to watch a bad episode of smallville watch subterranean now there's a sack of crap tom welling gives a good performance i don't say that very often and michael rosenbaum is great but he is most of the time the alternate universe scenario seems eerily realistic the martian manhunter who previously appeared in static returns and tells clark that the doctor that is the head of the insane asylum where they are being held at is actually a phantom from the phantom zone and if clark wants to return to his universe he must kill him an overall great episode with good acting and a decent pace	positive
where do we go from here that is the overriding question of this film and make no mistake 'mainly etc ' the 2003 effort from director john jansen asks far more questions than it answers but none so poignantly or so powerfully as this one much of the the film plays like a running conversation between you and your college drinking buddies and i'm sure many of the questions raised by the main characters you'll recognize from your own evenings of drunken debauchery however one of the many beauties of this film is that we are rarely given an answer questions are raised everything from the mundane to the profound but jansen skillfully forces his audience to examine and answer these questions ourselves with little to no help from the characters side 1 opens with an increasingly complex and beautifully orchestrated arrangement of non linear segments to introduce us to the main characters we meet them on the morning of april 8 1994 the day kurt cobain committed suicide and it is the death of cobain and the journey to his wake two days later in seattle that serve as the backdrop for the film in exploring cobain's life music and death the characters attempt with varying degrees of success to understand and come to terms with their own lives there are some aspects of the film that are what you might expect from a low budget indie film the performances range from decidedly mediocre to outstanding with the strongest performances coming from jessica scott holly and noel wood daniel some of the dialogue is admittedly a bit stiff but never completely strays into the unreal and there are some minor sound problems particularly once we get on the road that make it difficult at times to follow the action on screen but despite its shortcomings 'mainly etc ' is a solid deeply affecting piece of cinema amid moments of haunting poignancy laugh out loud humor and intimate turmoil jansen deftly weaves all of the character threads together and illuminates their own struggles while at the same time making them accessible and engaging for us and because we can see reflections of ourselves in one or more of these characters we can identify with the questions and issues they're struggling with and we're able to look back and remember where we were on that day in 1994 when for many people the world changed while jansen takes credit for the writing editing and direction of the film kudos must be given to his photography as well with an uncanny eye and amazing ability to capture and draw us into each of the characters' worlds jansen managed to produce shot after shot after shot that stuck with me long after the credits rolled and no review of this film would be complete without a nod to the amazing soundtrack the music in this film is used to amazing effect at times subtly underscoring the action at other times taking center stage but never getting in the way or deteriorating into kitschy music video the soundtrack plays like the ultimate greatest hits though i suspect that label would probably not sit very well with the director the new double dvd archive edition offers some deleted scenes trailers music videos and a cobain documentary the deleted scenes offer some insight into the making of the film through alternate opening and closing sequences and it's certainly a treat to have the rare and beautiful raining kind video the cobain documentary is fine if a bit worse for wear and certainly more extensive documentaries are available for the hardcore fans conspicuously absent is a director commentary and i can't help but wonder if jansen has plans to re release this at some point with that tasty tidbit attached suffice to say that the next time you're looking for a strong piece of work from a talented filmmaker i recommend you get on board	positive
based on a edgar rice burroughs novel at the earth's core provides little more than means to escape and give your brain a rest a victorian scientist dr abner perry peter cushing invents a giant burrowing machine which he and his american partner doug mcclure use to corkscrew their way deep into the earth to explore what mysteries it may hold they soon discover a lost world of subhuman creatures having conflict with prehistoric monsters cushing comes across as an absent minded professor to the point of being annoying instead of being a bold adventurer he comes across effeminate on the other hand mcclure overacted enough to make himself also laughable caroline munro plays the pretty princess dia that refuses to leave her world near the center of the earth also in the cast are godfrey james cy grant and michael crane	negative
this is an excellent film and one should not be put off by its strangeness there is genuine skill in manufacture of this work it manages to be intrigiung funny and frightening at various times work with it for the first few minutes and you won't be disappointed	positive
a lack of character development proves fatal for this movie valeria golino's character grazia starts out looking like a bipolar personality but quickly degenerates into a caricature and seems unreal the other characters are thin probably the writer's fault not the actors' the only exception is filippo pucillo as the younger son filippo his energy and bravado are funny and convincing i suppose the children's petty cruelty is supposed to contribute to an atmosphere of bleakness and emphasize the pervasive primal spirits in the town but for me the gratuitous cruelty is redundant and contributes to the overall boredom of the film some scenes were amusing but not necessarily intended that way for example when the mistreated dogs turn out to be fat and healthy and look like they are ready to show the pretty cast and setting make for an appealing trailer but cannot carry the whole movie	negative
our imp of the perverse did good his first time out thats for sure the music is the best you may ever hear by any human but you already know that unless you have no taste or have a brain that is too small to understand greatness a poor script that doesn't flesh out much of a story but at least it has its moments the breathtaking concert stuff is worth seeing it he deserved an oscar for this s t even though he was at times an ego driven twit with his towering bodyguard chick huntsbery always in front a movie that made non fans fans take it or leave it prince does need to stay clear of acting in the future though he takes himself way to serious he is a genius musician but pleaseee just enjoy the ride my purple maestro peace	positive
i think it's incredibly hard to write any kind of full scale review to giorgino merely because it's one of those viewer dependent complex poetical and philosophical movies that are brain wearing if while watching them you're trying to enjoy their shell and get to their core simultaneously yet there are several things which are certain and beyond any doubt for any man of art which i hope i am the first thing it's a certain masterpiece even of that kind of art which remains through a long long time the second it's one of those rare dark movies in which darkness is poetic even romantic attractive and much more sad than depressing like the art of pieter brueghel or caspar david friedrich as to the core of the movie someone called it kafkian though i don't agree with that because actually it's far beyond kafka's misanthropic logic and much more like edgar poe's parables dark and scary but through that touching the most gentle strings of our souls actually on the poetic side which is much more important than the narrative giorgino is a tale about eternal peace and love which can be achieved only through eternal childhood of soul those who have such souls are usually branded as crazy by our society but from another point of view they all have the virtue all the others lost when become grown the virtue of god's love indeed giorgino is a very christian movie be like children mt 18 3 is it's real hidden tag line though the movie never deals with any kind of moral and concentrates only on the christian philosophy for dare to suppose true god is beyond any human moral yet i think that boutonnat is too harsh portraying grown people as a sort of demons trying to steal childhood from rare survived souls but it's his point of view and he has a right to think so while watching giorgino don't try to look for some hidden symbols though there are some better look for thoughts expressed through characters and their behavior and do learn from them also i cannot mention that the movie looks astonishingly through excellent photography especially through rational use of color filters incredibly apposite editing wonderful acting of all the cast and of course due to the atmospheric beauty of winter mountains that reminded me of the brueghel's hunters in the snow also interestingly enough the scene with death in the form of an old woman with sunken black ringed eyes riding a cart instantly reminded me of pesta plague from the series of drawings by the norwegian painter theodor kittelsen depicting how a black plague is sweeping out the population of a small town in the mountain valley is it a coincidence	positive
this film is one of the worst adaptations of pride and prejudice ever filmed and if jane austen were alive she would demand that her name be removed from the film austen's novel is only superficially a story of the development of true love between elizabeth bennet and fitzwilliam darcy it is also a commentary on the class structure of regency britain this film focuses only on the love story thereby disappointing viewers who hoped it would do justice to the novel there are numerous problems with the historical accuracy of the film in the film the dance at which darcy snubs elizabeth is not the refined dancing done by the gentry to which the bennet lucas bingley and darcy families belong but is rather the dancing of the lower classes the gentry would not have been dancing as if they were at a peasant barn dance there are costume and hair problems too the custom of the period required married women to wear white cloth hats to cover their hair and for women to wear bonnets when outdoors women of the regency period were not so liberated as to forego the bonnet requirements in public the worst historical inaccuracy is the early morning meeting of elizabeth in her nightgown and coat and mr darcy sans cravat and vest at which they admit their love for each other this is an unforgivable liberty with the novel no respectable young woman or gentleman would venture out of doors in such a state of undress or seek to meet someone of the opposite sex at such an early hour but the worst thing of all with this film is the mangling of austen's dialogue and the atrocious modern dialogue austen's dialogue needs no assistance from a writer who thinks he she can write like austen the writer of the non austen dialogue not only lacks austen's talent but also has no feel for austen's style the juxtaposition of the two styles is jarring as for the acting the best is done by judi dench who clearly understands the imperiousness of the aristocracy brenda blethyn takes some liberties in making mrs bennet less awful than austen's portrayal her portrayal is interesting and seems to work donald sutherland is miscast his affected british accent is terrible and he portrays mr bennet too much as a father of the 20th century and not a father of the late 18th century matthew macfadeyn's portrayal of darcy is flat i can't imagine anyone falling in love with his mr darcy keira knightly is a pretty elizabeth but her portrayal of elizabeth bennet is far too modern knightly focuses on the elizabeth's forthrightness but her portrayal completely lacks an understanding of the social mores and conventions of the time she would have done well to actually read the novel before attempting to portray elizabeth and to do research on the behavior of women of the period if one is making a period movie one must be true to the period this film needed an historical adviser who actually knows something about the regency period it also needed a writer who has a better appreciation and understanding of austen's text i can only hope emma thompson decides to do a film of pride and prejudice in the near future to erase this abomination from our minds the best thing that can be said about this film is that it contains many pretty scenes of the english countryside chatsworth is well used as pemberly as it was in the 1995 bbc adaptation but pretty scenery and pretty actors cannot save this film true fans of austen will rush home to watch their dvds of the far superior 1995 bbc production with jennifer ehle and colin firth or to read austen's text in order to wipe this version from their minds	negative
okay so this wasnt what i was expecting i rented this film just to see how it would be since i want to see the first one anyway but this film had b movie all over it but when i watched it i realized that it was very funny for the first 30 minutes it was just how the snowman was kiiling people and one man losing his sanity but those first few minutes had some funny one liners in it when he throws up the first of his little minions i knew this would be very very funny they all act like the gremlins in the ninteen eighty four hit gremlins that it made it look like it was spoofing it and made me forget it was a b movie so if you like to laugh rent this one	positive

mighty like a moose is one of many short films director leo mccarey did starring charley chase what a dandy it is charlie and his wife both undergo plastic surgery to improve their hideous appearances unbeknown est to each other they then meet at a party and become smitten with each other now they can't allow each other to find out they're cheating that's the preposterous premise of this frantic farce vivien oakland one of the few comic short leads to have a flourishing career long after the silents is perfect as charley's long of nose wife charley has an awful case of buck teeth which are quickly dispatched at the dentist's after a party is raided by police for no other reason then to practice raids charley and his wife frantically try avoiding each other at home for fear the alterations in appearances become known both have been photographed with their new features at the party the hilarity back home culminates in charley trying to teach the no good nick cheating with his wife a lesson the no good nick of course is the new charley which his wife comes to realize long before charley teaches a lesson in faithfulness this is one of charley chase's better efforts of 4 stars	positive
i can understand after watching this again for the first time in many years how it is considered one of the worst laurel hardy's for me it isn't as close to as bad as air raid wardens and the bullfighters but there are some definite huge flaws in it the film is set up to show laurel and hardy as the owners and instructors of the dance studio hardy is funny as the prancing lead of a london bridge dance surrounded by 20th century fox starlets while in the next room laurel teaches the beginners ballet while wearing a ballerina outfit a clumsy carpenter spills glue on the floor leading to a predicable gag where hardy ends up the looser then in come the racketeers now selling insurance covering up their protection racket one of them is a very young and handsome robert mitchum but no sooner do they bully the boys into buying insurance they are arrested this is the end of the gangsters and the last time we see the dance studio the rest of the film is devoted to laurel and hardy's support of wealthy patron trudy marshall and her inventor boyfriend robert bailey they first try to help them hide their relationship from her disapproving parents matt briggs and margaret dumont and hopeful suitor allan lane whom we can tell right off is a no good swine this leads to briggs' hidden bar being revealed to tea totaling dumont and a gag where a rug is literally pulled out from the wealthy patriarch which crashes his bed into a pond below when bailey uses the boys to help display his ray gun pandemonium ensues the dead pan butler announces to case and dumont that their house is on fire later hardy wants to use the insurance policy to gain money to pay their dance studio rent and hopes to get laurel to break a leg to do so there is no reference to the fact that the insurance salesmen were gangsters and that the policy would probably be invalid even if they were to have become legitimate insurance salesman after being arrested their licenses would have been revoked laurel ends up getting off a bus which had been abandoned by the driver over a supposedly rabid dog only a frosting covered cake devouring toto look alike or possibly the actual pooch causing oliver to end up on a huge beach roller coaster that somehow the bus has ended up on perfectly fitting its wheels onto the tracks roller coaster gags can be exciting as evidenced in abbott and costello go to hollywood and this one is amusing but anticlimactic as the story wraps up all of these gags seem to have no point giving the impression that this was simply a series of one reelers put together to make a full length feature hopefully part of a double bill l h as i've mentioned in other reviews of their later films had lost much of their luster after leaving hal roach's employ but surprisingly here they do not come off as old and tired looking as they had in films made in the same year had the gags not been as amusing as was the case with some of their other films this surely would have ranked a 2 as opposed to a 3	negative
i got a few laughs out of this one more than a lot of other so called comedies the big ship was a knockout and getting to see a lot of it's scenery was fun as was getting to see some of dyan cannon's curves this wasn't the height of lemmon's and mattheau's career but it wasn't a total dog as some suggest	positive
this one grew on me i love the r d burman music and in spite of the cruder elements of the story i found much to be moved by as i kept re watching the movie the brother sister plot line is powerful i thought there's also more probably obligatory stuff like bar fights a loony crime story etc that are just distracting though not unfunny from a certain point of view also the english translation is definitely by someone for whom it was a bit of a stretch and as loony as it is i am grateful to him for doing it like many of the bollywood movies i've seen this one is melodramatic and opera like including here notably a song sung first by a little boy to cheer up his abused and unhappy sister and then the same song sung 12 or so years later by the man who has travelled to kathmandu seeking to re connect with this girl grown up and troubled she had been told her brother and mother were dead numbing her pain with drugs a super thing about this 1971 movie is that it is about the hippie movement which brought hordes of seekers to india from an indian point of view that sees them as people driven to india by a spiritual hunger aroused by the failings of their own societies but nonetheless in india living only for the pleasures of the moment the hippie singing dancing drugging scenes are truly wonderful and accurate in their tone i'm old enough to remember and i feel pretty sure that the masses of young white zoned out kids are actual hippie extras as i remember hearing about kids on the caravan to the east getting this kind of work in bollywood it is not about the actual hare krishna movement though the movie hippies sing a krishna rama chant as do a group of actual indian devotees unrelated to the hippies in the opening scene of the movie virginia	positive
fires on the plain directed by kon ichikawa and written by shohei ooka and natto wada is a world war two movie which is finally not showing the allies fighting the axis powers but the japanese fighting and struggling for their lives on the philippines the main characters name is tamura played by eiji funakoshi and he is a soldier leaving his regiment because of him being sick all he has on him is a hand grenade his gun and some potatoes like this he is trying to make his way to the hospital in order to get a doctor and a cure for his disease but since the hospital turned him away and gets destroyed he begins a long walk throughout the whole movie tamura remains a bit cowardish but very civil when the other soldiers become more like animals by using their basic instincts for survival tamura is still remaining human and would not degrade a scene which has influenced me a lot to think positively and different about this war movie is when tamura comes into a phillipino village which is completely deserted there he fights a dog and finds a lot of corpses of japanese soldiers stacked up in front of a church this makes tamura think and even more scared than he already is that shows that the soldier is not a brave killing machine but a servant to higher beings and human most importantly after he turns away from the corpses two phillipinos a couple or brother and sister very close relationship return to the village in order to get their stash of salt back the main character of the movie wants to be friendly at first although he walked up to them with his gun but shoots the woman once she starts screaming her brother boyfriend husband then runs away in fear and after a moment tamura follows him and shoots wildly at the fleeing filipino he does not hit him after tamura picks up the bag of salt something very precious he drops his gun into a river this gesture is very important in order to understand kon ichikawa's shohei ooka's profiling of tamura and the war comparing this movie to other world war 2 movies it is not typical at all of course all movies have suffering heroes but their heroes are more heroic than tamura he expresses everything that is human he is getting manipulated he is weak he gets scared he has hope this is typical for japanese world war two movies and for japanese society since world war two is not a discussed theme in japanese society japanese are likely to put japanese in the second world war in the role of the victim this victimisation is also very visual in this movie one of the examples is tamura another one the piled up bodies of japanese soldiers in front of the church and another important one is when the japanese soldiers are trying to cross a street and the americans are already waiting there for them and shooting all of the japanese soldiers which have worse equipment and are fed worse and have no health equipment or anything alike in my personal conclusion i have to say that it is worth seeing this film in order to finally see a movie from the other side than usual it also has no nationalistic propaganda which could've been easily built in once you have watched the movie fully you will be able to see the horrors of the second world war to its total extent	positive
isabelle huppert is a wonderful actor the director of la pianiste understands this providing the viewer with long takes of huppert's face and these are a pleasure to see huppert is not an animated actor she registers emotion with the smallest lift of an eyebrow or flicker of a smile other than the enjoyment of watching an experienced actor excel in her profession there is nothing in this movie that makes me want to recommend it well if you enjoy self mutilation sado masochism and bizarre behavior la pianiste might work for you other than these attributes i could not find any redeeming value in it buried in all this strange material there is a kernel of truth people who compete at the very highest level musically athletically whatever begin as strange people and are shaped into stranger people by the competitive environment not worth a trip to a movie theater to relearn this life lesson	negative
obsessed i have every season of gilmore girls and i think the reason i love it so much is because of how smart the script is its not your average comedy show there isn't any pause after a joke it just keeps on if you missed you missed it and its not like a soap opera drama either because it doesn't use dramatic music and the actors never have those stupid cheesy surprise looks i think gilmore girls is one of the bests shows on t v shows of its time its fun because they talk so fast you can't get everything the first time its nice to go back and laugh at the other jokes also they have so many references its amazing how smart it is and you can relate to the characters also their so real and there actors are superb from the witty lorelai to the hermit luke to the immature kirk the show is just amazing i definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time and spend sometime with there family this is definitely the show for them there is only one word that can describe gilmore girls classic	positive

edward furlong and christina ricci are an excellent couple and demonstrate it with their unique charisma featured in this movie this is the typical alternative or indie movie with a plot that features a rare situation that suddenly becomes really important pecker is an average boy who has an old camera and his main hobby is to take photographs of the exotic habitants of the small town where he lives in suddenly an alternative artist pays attention to his work and hires him in order to expose his work in some important festivals and more but pecker life changes drastically as now fortune and fame seem to infuriate the town's people who are pecker's main inspiration even his sexy girlfriend gets mad because now he does not pays the adequate attention to her well this is an indie movie with an edge but not for everyone it may seem boring or pretentious for some people but still i think it worths a watch only because it offers something different than hollywood's typical standards to describe in a few words this is the typical christina ricci and john waters movie that's it oh and i almost forgot to mention that the full of grace lines are really annoying geez	positive
baseketball is an extremely funny movie that delivers acting that generally makes the movie alot funnier comedy material that is more than crap in your pants funny and a pretty good plot despite the fact that its the classic slackers v s the evil rich guy the one and only thing i didnt like about baseketball was that that kid wasnt really needed in the movie but if the kid wasnt in the movie some of the funny scenes wouldnt have existed if you have read any pro reviews about this movie exclude them all because basically all the reviewers didnt like this film baseketball is a great comedy that gives everyone what they want 8 out of 10	positive
now i really liked this movie it was so funny both akshay kumar and john abraham are brilliant actors i think after watching this film they should do lots more films together in the future akshay kumar gets himself into a bit of trouble by dating 3 women at the same time but the way he handles in when one comes out of the door and then the other one was just so funny to watch he acted really well int his film and i hope that he makes more great comedy's like this one in the future john abraham plays his best friend he plays his role really well and he is so underrated i am glad that some of his amazing work has got noticed but he is a really good actor i just love john neha dhupia has a small role in this film and plays it well the muse is really good i really recommend this movie to everyone	positive
as far as fake documentaries go fakumentaries anyone this one is up there with the best it looks very real and that is what it aims for in recent light of events guantanamo this movie is even scarier so you could say it was ahead of it's time when it was released in the 70s one can only hope that a government like that doesn't exist looking for terrorists and interviewing people just like that of course the people interviewed all seemed to have the same 70s mentality screw the politicians and politics in general maybe that wasn't so clever one might think but hey don't forget it's only a movie o	positive
i was shocked at how good this german version of films such as scream was surpassing all the modern american efforts at slasher films it as what all those films don't likable characters genuine mystery suspense graphic murders and a brilliant soundtrack this stylish horror film is one of the best of its kind to come out in years german cinema is going from strength to strength just lately its a shame more people wont go to see such films because they are missing out it is easily available on dvd so even if you hate subtitles i think you should see it it will be one of the best horror films you will see all year	positive
after looking for this bruceploitation for months and then accidentally buying it cheap it was disappointing i heard about it on a dvd r site and it sounded crazy but no what i got was a pretty bad martial arts movie the kung fu ing wasn't too bad but the rest of the movie was pretty awful and made the movie seem really really long much longer then it's 85 minute runtime on a positive note the ape was funny for a couple of seconds especially when i think they took the only close up of it's face from another movie and the black guy who pops up half way through was funny because of the one line he said which singlehandedly made all black people look like complete simpletons but it wasn't enough sadly 4 10	negative
his has to surely be one of the worst gay themed films of all time who told any of the so called actors that they can act bad sound bad script gestures so overboard that they defy reality a nightclub scene with only one actor and dubbed crowd scenes after seeing other low budget films similarly made i was prepared for something innovative but not plain pathetic parents and friends really should not encourage anyone to make such tripe and the dvd no menu access its worse than a vhs tape once you start you have to watch the whole thing through luckily the fast forward button works with this film and dvd nothing else does	negative
treading water is a very beautiful movie i would put it straight under the wonderful short movie cosa bella from fiona mackenzie it's not only about coming out but also about tolerance and acceptance in general i am looking forward to seeing more of laurel himmel's work in the future the actors angie redman and nina landey are quite good the main characters relationship could have been strenghtened a bit as we understand there is a very strong bond between them but maybe this could have been explained a bit i am surprised that angie redman doesn't appear much in other movies a great first step as a director for laurel himmel i am sure there's more to see from her skills	positive
this is a very entertaining flick considering the budget and its length the storyline is hardly ever touched on in the movie world so it also brought a sense of novelty the acting was great p'z to dom and the cinematography was also very well done i recommend this movie for anyone who's into thrillers it will not disappoint you	positive

one of my favourite domestic movies i don't know if there is any person in our country who hasn't seen this movie it's funny and sad at some moments i don't know how did people around the world who had opportunity to watch it accept this movie because you have to know some moments in our serbian history and character of serbs in the first half of the 20th century to be able to understand it but as i see here there is somebody from canada who watched it and he liked it i think that i'll try to put all good quotes from the movie on this site but first to find out how to do that cheers	positive
once upon a time there was a great american film which combined horror and comedy with equal thrills this film featured clever direction groundbreaking special effects and superb comedic and serious acting it was entitled 'an american werewolf in london ' sixteen years later the long awaited sequel was finally pinned onto the poster board outside your local theater surely it would have at least some of the thrills of the original think again 'an american werewolf in paris' is an incomprehensible mess from start to pitiful finish the problems begin with the leading man tom everett scott's performance is stiff and tiresome from the outset he seems intent on proving that all young people are simpletons in his defense not even a seasoned shakespearean thespian could have extracted a good performance from the juvenile and witless dialogue at one point one of scott's deceased friends who's soul is doomed to walk the earth after being carved up by one of the werewolves is finally able to leave for the afterlife he then quips to scott and his friends 'okay guys see ya ' what a memorable goodbye julie delphy soon shows up as scott's mysterious european love interest basically she's a french girl playing the french girl it isn't much of a stretch but all this stupidity isn't even the most disappointing thing about the film the special effects such an integral part of the superb original film fall far short in this flop the werewolves look like cartoons and no matter how well you sculpt a cartoon with sinewy lycanthrope muscles it's still hard to get scared of a cartoon so instead the vacationing american gang led by the ultra weak scott keep finding excuses to return to the werewolf's catacombs lair here it's much easier for this incompetent special effects crew to keep the computer enhanced creatures or absurd beast masks under the cover of darkness some have said that if you don't look on this film as a sequel it's not as bad by comparison i disagree this film can not stand on its own and is even more of a disgrace when compared to the brilliant original if it doesn't want to be looked on as a sequel it should not have borrowed most of the title from the 1981 film i don't care how much you love werewolves or how much you worshiped 'american werewolf in london ' as i myself did this one is simply not worth wasting your time 'okay guys see ya ' terrible 3 out of a possible 10 t h	negative
i loved this movie the scenery was breathtaking the plot had some nice twists and turns and the characters were well rounded on two fronts however rob roy scored far above average first i have rarely seen a popular film in which the quality of dialogue was so high there were many verbal slashes and thrusts to accompany the brilliantly choreographed swordplay i could give numerous examples but why should i just watch the film second this movie understood a principle rarely acknowledged any more for a drama to succeed it needs not only a hero but a really believable villain if you don't have one there's not much joy in rooting for the good guys and rob roy has not one but three the earl of montrose his henchman kilairn and archie not one dimensional villains either but fully fleshed and very nasty it takes a bit more patience than braveheart there's more dialogue and the accents are a bit tough but it's a much more clever and subtle piece as i said i loved this movie	positive

i'd been following this films progress for quite some time so perhaps expected a little too much i consider both gillian anderson and danny dyer to be good at what they do and was interested to see what dan reed could come up with but unfortunately it just didn't work for me the problem lies in the fact that the film doesn't really seem to understand which genre it's falling into and as such it fails to impress on drama horror and thriller elements because rather than focusing on one of them and doing it well it's a bit of a jack of all trades and master of none the premise as with most revenge films is simple couple meet and go out something bad happens and they get their revenge it's a simple formula and one that many directors have handled expertly over the years unfotunately in this case it's as if dan reed thought it'd be great to do one of those revenge films that goes a little deeper by showing a more human side to all the characters and delving into their mental state in more detail wrong there are also a few key elements missing in this type of movie there's generally some kind of warning a don't do this or this might happen element which adds to the tension but there's nothing of the sort here it just simply happens then nothing happens for an hour then something interesting happens and then it ends there's a lot of really stiff competition in this genre and hats of to dan reed for trying i have no issue with his directing abilities but in term of writing i'd say next time he should stick to the formula for the type of film he's making instead of trying to be too clever and he'll have a quality movie on his hands	negative
mann photographs the alberta rocky mountains in a superb fashion and jimmy stewart and walter brennan give enjoyable performances as they always seem to do but come on hollywood a mountie telling the people of dawson city yukon to elect themselves a marshal yes a marshal and to enforce the law themselves then gunfighters battling it out on the streets for control of the town nothing even remotely resembling that happened on the canadian side of the border during the klondike gold rush mr mann and company appear to have mistaken dawson city for deadwood the canadian north for the american wild west canadian viewers be prepared for a reefer madness type of enjoyable howl with this ludicrous plot or to shake your head in disgust	negative
i went to see glenn mcquaid's i sell the dead in it's north american premiere at the toronto after dark film festival seeing as this is the second showing worldwide i didn't quite know what to expect of this film especially having not seen the short film that inspired this big screen adaptation i'll start off with a slightly more elaborate plot synopsis without giving away any spoilers this movie is about arthur blake how he became a grave robber and the interesting and supernatural discoveries that both he and his mentor discovered the costume and set design in this film were excellent i was amazed to hear that the entire film was shot in and around new york the costumes were very accurate to the time really bringing you as a viewer into the mindset of the time this movie works just as well as a period piece as it does a horror comedy the interaction between the two leads was very fluid they played off each others acting with ease the dialogue between the two was very well written with glenn adding his comedic touch even in tense situations the story is very encompassing and the ball gets rolling from the very start i'd compare it to a visual page turner always wondering just what will happen next the characters themselves are all very vivid and unique adding different emotional layers to the film itself all in all i recommend this film for anyone in the mood for some dark humour with a bit of horror mixed in 9 10	positive
where do i start first off the story sucks the acting sucks the effects really suck i guess i'll start with the story the story for komodo vs cobra number one it doesn't explain how or when the komodo and the cobra even got there or for that matter how it was created the acting terrible it seems like the director just pulled a few people from the street which is probably what he did and last and definitely the least the effects they are so horrible that the komodo doesn't even look like a komodo just a dinosaur that looks incredibly unrealistic the water doesn't even move when the cobra appears all in all terrible piece of crap don't even think about renting it	negative
pierce brosnan the newest but no longer james bond is an assassin he is very very good at what he does but he's getting old and tired greg kinnair is really good as the straight and narrow business man now when the story opens the movie shows these two people in their separate lives then one night they are having drinks in a bar and they begin to talk then all of a sudden you find these two people getting drawn together during a series of events the story is excellent the acting is top notch and the humor is hilarious i never thought that pierce brosnan would be this funny but he really is and i must say this movie is a must see	positive
i watched pola x because scott walker composed the film score and i admire his music a lot frankly i expected a somewhat pretentious and possibly incoherent french movie i was wrong the vision of the film quickly managed to engage my attention to the fullest starting with the opening sequence which shows black and white footage of military airplanes throwing bombs at graves at the sounds of music and scott walker's beautiful wailing voice the film explores the identity crisis of pierre guillaume depardieu a brilliant choice for the role and his consequential self destruction the story is divided into two parts the first depicts pierre's carefree life in a beautiful house in the french countryside and the second follows his utter personal disintegration after he abandons everything and moves to paris to live in squalor with his supposed half sister both parts contain some amazingly stunning photography the first very colorful and bright the second utterly gloomy and nearly apocalyptic adding up to a true aesthetic feast pola x is a fascinating and quite unique movie experience	positive
ok now lets see what was funny in the first movie i know people with funny accents people falling into the water silly boat crashes and funny comments between the two teams in this movie they have twisted the accent part to the max no good a whole a lot of people are falling into the water for uncertain reasons no good boatcrash check funny comments between the two teams they tried but failed also there are too may personalities they are following in this movie this film should be about what is happening on the water not on land i am sorry to say that there is too far between the funny parts and the sponsors of the film are exploited to the max no good all in all i give it four out of ten since it has some funny parts	negative
i was a little afraid when i went to the cinema to see this movie indeed it is always tough to make a movie from a comics and the first episode of the adventures of the french two greatest heroes was good but not fantastic finally it is very funny from the beginning to the end with unexpected gags some cartoon scenes no timeouts great fx a great cast great landscapes great everything however i wonder how they will manage to translate all the french names in english or german because it is certainly funny in french but how will it be in another language	positive
i'm aware that there are some fans who might like this movie i'm aware that the idea of 'searching for god' might appear interesting to some to me however it's really boring the movie is simply boring when it does get a little bit interesting it gets stupid come on kirk fights against god and wins how low can we possibly get the only good part in the film is the camping scene at the first 5 minutes which is truly great but after that the movie becomes boring irritating with nothing more than a good music thank god we have star trek vi oops kirk beat him	negative
if you get the slight enjoyment out of pink floyd's music you will love this movie the score is completely pink floyd and of course the drug element plays a major part in this movie giving you the doubts about life within the weakest moments this movie also touches the heart with the story about love and the people around you there is also a huge connection with the world around you with the environment of a personal island this thing tell me i need ten lines to sum up a movie but i am done that is all you get that is why this movie is a 6 1 which is a major upset to any movie with a score like this take a look at requiem for a dream and the fountain equally good scores for our generation but overestimated	positive
this is the neil simon piece of work that got a lot of praises the odd couple is a one of a kind gem that lingers within you got felix ungar jack lemmon a hypochondriac fussy neat freak and a big thorn in the side of his roommate oscar madison walter matthau a total slob these men have great jobs though felix is a news writer and oscar is a sports writer both of these men are divorced felix's wife is nearby while oscar's is on the other side of the u s the west coast well what can you say two men living in one roof together without driving each other crazy is impossible as well as improbable it's a whole lot of laughs and a whole lot of fun i liked the part where when those two british neighbors that speak to both gentlemen and after oscar kicked out felix he gets lucky and lives with them when he refused to have dinner with them the night earlier it's about time that felix needed to lighten up i guess all neat freaks neat to lighten up they can be fussy yet they should be patient as well a very fun movie and a nuevo classic neil simon's the odd couple is a must see classic movie 5 stars	positive
normally i am a pretty generous critic but in the case of this film i have to say it was incredibly bad i am stunned by how positive most reviews seem to be there were some gorgeous shots but it's too bad they were wasted on this sinkhole of a movie it might have worked if daggers was purely an action flick and not a romance but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle there is no chemistry between either of the couples whatever exists between mei and her men seems to be more lust than love and for the most part the dialogue is just silly this may be just a problem with translation but the frequent usage of the word flirt in particular reminded me of 8th grade not head over heels together forever worth dying for love i also felt we were beat over the head with the wind metaphor the audience is given very little about the characters to really care about and therefore very little emotional investment in the movie as a whole i was wishing for a remote control to fast forward i was slumped in my seat ready to snore but mostly i just cringed a lot spoiler now the icing on the cake or rather adding insult to injury the ending was truly one of the most horrible laughable ones i have ever seen the boys are having their stag fight and screaming and yelling and hacking at each other oh and then it starts to snow randomly oh and then mei dagger embedded in heart suddenly pops up out of the weeds then she throws a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach it's destination even slowing conveniently midscreen to hit a tiny blood droplet wow cool well then mei dies finally i guess because she threw the dagger that was lodged in her chest and bled to death jin sings sobs holds her body close screen goes blank i and the people surrounding me are chuckling not a good sign visually stunning but ultimately a failure	negative
the moral of this show is that bad eating habits give people bad hair bad taste in clothes bad posture bad jobs and on and on they are obviously miserable and loathe themselves however if they learn to eat broccoli they will be wealthy successful and attractive tlc ought to be ashamed of themselves for this blatant exploitation of parental fears and guilt if nutrition is really that important they should be able to develop a show using honest and truthful methods if they really believed in their computer simulations i'd like to see them do a double blind test by finding some 40 year olds finding out what their eating and exercise habits were as children and age progressing the kids' photos then compare to the real things hey that sounds like a project for mythbusters discovery channel are you listening tlc must stand for tabloid lies and cons	negative
i enjoyed still crazy more than any film i have seen in years a successful band from the 70's decide to give it another try they start by playing some gigs in some seedy european venues with hilarious results the music is fantastic the script and acting are terrific the characters are spot on especially the lead singer with the high heavy metal voice makeup and personality problems the concert at the end was unreal go and see it preferably in a cinema with a good sound system	positive
i have seen this movie since i was a little girl and being from new york and remembering how people lived back then brought back a lot of good memories this movie is not just about wanting a fairy tale ending but understanding the struggles of becoming a better person woman and provider claudine attempted to be it was about the welfare system putting women in a binding situation it was about the injustice of a system that invaded and put demands on a family to stay afloat diane carroll was nominated for an oscar for this role and it was well deserved if you want to experience a strong family with conflicting but wonderful bonding moments enjoy claudine your goal as a viewer is to keep an open mind and understand the overall frustration	positive
i tend to like historical period films and get new ideas for costumes for my historical group and a friend recommended this one to me i like johnny lee miller as an actor so i figured it was worth it and i was definitely rewarded his portrayal as a member of the english noble class was by far more accurate than i've seen in the past the comedy aspect of it left my sides hurting the costumes weren't awful and historically i didn't wince too much i also noticed the fact that england didn't have a proper sewage system until much later but anyone who dose not go deep into the minutae of england's past won't notice nor care absolutely worth seeing i highly recommend this movie	positive
i saw this when it first came to video my little sister got it as a gift and i was probably 12 at the time what stood out for me was the lack of mid movie conflict that so many movies have where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just don't say the one thing that you're shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say this is what i like the most about the movie i guess that the main characters don't do mean things to each other halfway through they don't break up and make up they just grow to like each other more as the movie goes on these two kids team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite sides of the track they're not that different loui is actually just some middle class kid that needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family and cecelia was an upper class kid that just needed to prove to her family that she existed and they would miss her if she was gone anyway i saw this movie posted on hulu and had to watch it again sure there's plot holes if you analyze the script and no woog and dweeb shouldn't be eating hot dogs since they would have been herbivores in reality now what detracts from the film is it's unexpected scariness little kids under the age of 5 would probably be frightened by the scenes with dr screweyes and the addition of him halfway through the movie though it's blatantly obvious in the first scene that he will make an appearance is too abrupt there should be a glimpse of him doing his show earlier in the movie perhaps to show that it's not that scary without the the dinosaurs i guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second half considering the target audience who i'm sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues i think i'll give it a pass on those factors too and just enjoy the story it's a great flick for kid and it does stick in your mind makes you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be revisited every 10 years i think	positive
big bad ralph is also on the not so squeazy truck commercials and can be found at numerous brothels around melbourne any given night terrible film by the way wasn't shocking just bad uninteresting the main guy was in charge of the metal section on countdown and was the lead bouncer at a gay night club in melbourne i dunno who the women where probably pros's that ralph knew no story of interest its one of those fast forward jobs please look up big bad ralph at brothels around melbourne hes famous in them i wish i could give 0 10 but ill give it 1 only cos i cant give 0	negative
estevez martin sheen and kathy bates are superb in this portrayal of a vietnam vet home from the war but still haunted by it bates plays a clueless mother who just wants the family to be a family sheen is terrific as the father who tries to understand what his son is going through but is too wrapped up in his principles to really empathize the setting is thanksgiving day and the relatives are coming for dinner estevez who plays the returning vet wants no part of family tradition and insists on wearing his combat fatigues to dinner explaining this is what i wore last thanksgiving the bickering and family arguments are priceless particularly the peanut brittle crisis but the ending is both gripping and terrifying it has to be seen to be appreciated overall one of the best movies i've ever seen	positive
this movie was so great i am a teenager and i and my friends all love the series so it just goes to show that these movies draw attention to all age crowds i recommend it to everyone my favorite line in this movie is when logan bartholomew says rosy cheeks when he is talking about his baby daughter he is such a great actor as well as erin cottrell they pair up so well and have such a great chemistry i really hope that they can work again together they are such attractive people and are very good actors i have finally found movies that are good to watch lately it has been hard for me to find movies that are good and show good morals and christian values but at the same time these movies aren't cheesy	positive
i've also been looking to find this movie for quite some time and how great it would be to find it on dvd i saw this movie when i was about 6 years old in the netherlands and i was very impressed by it it was shown before walt disney's jungle book what i remember of this movie is fragmented i remember that an indian boy was friends with an eagle this impressed me very much for some reason he was thrown out of his village did not grasp the reason for this when other boys threw stones at him he climbed a rock and jumped off at that time he turned into an eagle and flew away with his eagle friend as an eagle he was still wearing his turquoise necklace cb	positive
i absolutely loved this movie it's my number one favorite although there were a few flaws what movie doesn't have flaws this movie was very well written directed and produced the characters in this movie are very real and believable they made all of the characters fit into a specific role i think that the most apparent thing about here on earth was the love triangle as well as the other emotional situations brought into the movie it's not one of those movies where you just can't seem to relate to anything because in it are situations that everyone is or has been in there are so many different things going on in this movie that it is hard not to relate to it i am just 18 years old and i can even relate to it it was heart warming and wrenching at the same time here on earth will make you laugh cry and sometimes angry i give this movie an excellent review and recommend it to anyone who loves romance and passion	positive
this was keaton's first feature and is in actuality three shorts set in different periods stone age roman age modern age on the eternal triangle of romance the stories parallel each other as in griffith's intolerance which this was intended to satirize the strengths of the jokes and gags almost all rely on anachronisms bringing modern day business into ancient settings warning spoilers follow to elaborate best points here are the classic moments using a turtle as a wee gee board stone age a wrist watch containing a sun dial roman age a chariot with a spare wheel roman age using a helmet as a tire lock roman age early golf with clubs and rocks stone age dictating a will being carved into a rock stone age the changing weather forecaster roman age the chariot race in snow buster using skis and huskies with a spare dog in the chariot's boot roman age the above are all throw away gags that keep us chuckling there are however unforgettable moments as well buster taking out shaving equipment to match girl putting on make up the fantastic double take when an inebriated buster gazes at his plate to discover a crab staring up at him within one second he has leaped to stand on his chair from a sitting position and leaped again into the arms of the waiter one of the funniest moments i've ever seen and that lion the manicure just brilliant there's also an off color bit of racism when four african american litter bearers abandon their mistress for a roman crap game kino's print is a bit fuzzy and contains numerous sequences of both nitrate deterioration and film damage most probably at ends of reels the metro feature is scored with piano and flute and borrows heavily from grieg lots of fun and full of laughs	positive
there is a lot to like here the actors are first rate and the script provides good dialog best capturing the ambiance of a tightly knit likable family however for that reason the film does not ring true we see leo who apparently just learned of his hiv positive diagnosis essentially react in a way that is not in tune to the supportive atmosphere for which he finds himself as well the film ends somewhat abruptly avoiding what leo his brother and the rest of this close family must have dealt with in light of their love for him the young actor who plays leo's brother marcel is impressive as generally is the rest of the cast unfortunately the scriptwriters could not decide onwhether they wanted an insightful dissertation on the effects of hiv on a functional appealing family or what the devastation hiv is on the victim so it only hints at both while this film provides food for thought it leaves the viewer wanting much more than it delivers	negative
back in 74 eric monte made the classic t v show good times jj has always been my favorite and i love watching the reruns on t v land jimmie walker always seemed to be the star and not esther rolle john amos most of the time felt a little jealous of jimmie walker's popularity winning millions of fans time to sit and watch good times the show would have been dead if jj would't have been there to save it with his always kool aid attitude drinking kool aid was like his favorite thing on the show i was 3 when it came out and 8 when it ended instead of 1974 1979 it should have went longer like in the 1980's when i was just growing up	positive
channel 4 is a channel that allows more naughty stuff than any of the other channels this show was certainly a naughty one the presenter of this sometimes gross adult chat show four time bafta winning and british comedy award winning also twice nominated graham norton was just the perfect gay host for a good show like this it had one or more famous celebrities in the middle of it they basically had an adult idea which would either gross humiliate or humour the guest but some are not for the faint hearted they had women playing the recorder with their parts men using their dicks to play a xylophone women weeing upwards in the bath men with or without pants under their kilts and many more gross but hilarious ideas this is just for adults but enjoy it it won the bafta twice for best entertainment programme or series it won the british comedy awards for best comedy entertainment programme also nominated best comedy talk show it won an emmy for episode 18 and it won the national television awards twice for most popular talk show it was number 52 on the 100 greatest funny moments very good	positive
ten out of the 11 short films in this movie are masterpieces i found only the egyptian one disappointing stragely all but the mexican director chose to portray the problems of individuals or groups in connection with 9 11 the afghan refugees deaf people palestinians the widows of srebrenica aids and poverty and corruption in africa pinochets coup and ensuing bloodbath suicide bombings in israel paranoia hit and state persecuted muslim americans in the usa old people living alone and the aftermath of wwii in the hearts of asian soldiers this might say something sad about the limits of empathy in both ways the directors might feel that americans ignore the pains of the rest of the world and only care about their own tragedies while they effectively do the same with their short films surprising myself i found sean penn's piece one of the very best in the collection and spoiler ahead i also guess his portrayal of ernest borgnine as a half crazy old man vegetating in a new york flat experiencing his widow life's happiest moment when the sun shines through his window after the wtc collapsed out of light's way i guess this might also be one of the most offending as the general american audience would see it	positive
skip all the subjective this is a great film reviews and read the imdb trailer or the back the kino videobox which includes both versions of this flick which i'll paraphrase to the tune of sci fi score by george antheil the camera goes on a sleepwalk through b movie hell all photographed by will thompson who did 'plan 9 from outer space' 'maniac' you don't know whether to laugh at the film or with it so if you like self produced b or c grade noir wannabe actors and effects with pretensions of surrealism this could be for you otherwise get a copy of screamplay a modern low budget expressionist masterpiece	negative

four or five episodes of johnnie socko and his flying robot edited together amusing giant robot battling giant monsters tale aimed squarely at kids parents of course will go crazy since the action is violent with the robot monster battles resembling professional wrestling and the human on human violence the sort of stuff you'd find in the al capone st valentine's day school and gangster training academy i liked it but then again i grew up on the series if there is any problems other than the men in suits effects variety is that the movie plays like a series of episodes stitched together with a climax coming every 20 minutes recommended for those who've run out of ultraman or godzilla	positive

greystoke the legend of tarzan lord of the apes is based on the classic book tarzan of the apes by edgar rice burroughs and is a more faithful adaptation to the classic book the film has some great scenery like the jungles of south africa to the greystoke mansion the acting is also great chirstopher lambert did a great performance as tarzan it was also his first english speaking role the film has some funny moments sad moments and touching moments that makes this a real classic the film sees a boat crashing in the jungles of south africa and some time later they have a son named john the apes go into the hut and one of them kills the father the apes then take him to where they live and adopt him as one of their own as the years go by john grows up and learns to be more like the apes in his teens his foster mom gets attacked by native hunters and soon killed by them years later a group of people are going to africa on a expedition after setting up camp they're soon attacked by the natives most escape but capitaine phillippe d'arnot is left behind injured by some of the arrows after hiding he meets john now an adult who takes him to his home and takes care of his wounds after a while phillippe starts to teach john how to speak english and teach him that he's not one of the apes but a person when phillippe goes to leave john goes with him after sometime they arrive at greystoke manor where the sixth earl of greystoke is shown his long lost grandson john is shown his bedroom and picture of his true mom and dad john also meets jane porter and slowly as they get to know each other he begins to have feelings for her when it's christmas the sixth earl of greystoke slides down the stairs killing himself john then starts to miss the jungle and wants to return but phillipe tells him to stay since everything they had done would be for nothing john is then torn between his life as a greystoke and the lord of the apes greystoke the legend of tarzan lord of the apes is a great classic that should be seen 10 10	positive
one of the best love stories i have ever seen it is a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion but lovely nonetheless big edie and little edie seem a bit like family members after watching this movie repeatedly and are infinitely quotable it's a goddamned beautiful day now will you just shut up the opening explanation of little edie's costume only promises that the movie will live on forever and so will big edie the world famous singer and little edie the world famous dancer	positive
how irish critics rave about this movie is beyond me overacted by the usual band of irish actors dragged out for every irish movie terrible script with forced character quirks the brown sauce romanticising all that is bad about dublin the attitude of 'ah it's a dump but sure isnt it great all the same' plenty of tidbits purely for american audiences the supermarket boss and his horribly forced catchphrase and the nail in the coffin was colm meaney's character a great actor forced to play this part that could've been written by a five year old cringeworthy stuff the best thing about this movie is farrell and it's a bad when you have to say that well at least he wasnt putting on his dreadful american accent international audiences be warned stay at home and watch snatch and lock stock you'll have a better time intermission is a walk outer	negative

fear and desire is of interest mainly to kubrick obsessives who can plumb this pretentious clap trap for signs of his still to come greatness kubrick was right in seeking to ensure that the film was not screened or available on legitimate video he considered it embarrassing and amateurish and he was correct in his evaluation this is a weak and tedious film at 68 minutes it still seems longer than barry lyndon it nevertheless is of historical interest and has its genuine absorbing moments it's a difficult film to find only unofficial copies are in circulation though perhaps this may change if kubrick's estate relents and has it released on video recommended only for kubrick enthusiasts	negative
i am so happy and surprised that there is so much interest in this movie jack frost was my introduction into the films produced and distributed by a pix entertainment and without exception everything this company deals with is pure crap first and this is very important never ever watch this movie sober why would you unlike many other entertaingly bad movies this one i feel was made intentionally bad i just can't get over how fake the snowman is which is why its always shown only briefly the way it moves is the best this movie is waaaaaaaaaaay better than the michael keaton piece of crap becuz that was made too be a good movie and that version is as bad as this	negative
this is the first recorded effort to put sound with a movie and a the oldest that obviously is still in existence this historic piece of film is the opening segment in the more treasures of the natural archives dvd it's only a 15 second clip of a man playing a violin in front of a huge recording cylinder next to him are two men dancing near the end another man walks on the stage william dickson the director of this experiment is the violin player this movie had several titles over the years but the sound experiment was not really a success it took over 30 years from this point to the synchronize sight and sound to the point where something could be issued to the public for entertainment however this was a start no matter how primitive it came off for more of the technical information and history of this film process see the other review here by boba fett1138	negative
this low budget erotic thriller that has some good points but a lot more bad one the plot revolves around a female lawyer trying to clear her lover who is accused of murdering his wife being a soft core film that entails her going undercover at a strip club and having sex with possible suspects as plots go for this type of genre not to bad the script is okay and the story makes enough sense for someone up at 2 am watching this not to notice too many plot holes but everything else in the film seems cheap the lead actors aren't that bad but pretty much all the supporting ones are unbelievably bad one girl seems like she is drunk and or high the cinematography is badly lit with everything looking grainy and ugly the sound is so terrible that you can barely hear what people are saying the worst thing in this movie is the reason you're watching it the sex the reason people watch these things is for hot sex scenes featuring really hot girls in red shoe diary situations the sex scenes aren't hot they're sleazy shot in that porno style where everything is just a master shot of two people going at it the woman also look like they are refuges from a porn shoot i'm not trying to be rude or mean here but they all have that breast implants and a burned out weathered look even the title deviant obsession sounds like a hardcore flick not that i don't have anything against porn in fact i love it but i want my soft core and my hard core separate what ever happened to actresses like shannon tweed jacqueline lovell shannon whirry and kim dawson women that could act and who would totally arouse you and what happened to b erotic thrillers like body chemistry nighteyes and even stripped to kill sure none of these where masterpieces but at least they felt like movies plus they were pushing the envelope going beyond hollywood's relatively prude stance on sex sexual obsessions and perversions now they just make hard core films without the hard core sex	positive

the problem with the 1985 version of this movie is simple indiana jones was so closely modeled after alan quartermain or at least is an alan quartermain type of character that the '85 director made the mistake of plundering the ij movies for dialog and story far too deeply what you got as a finished product was a jumbled mess of the name alan quartermain in an uneven hodge podge of a cheaply imitated ij saga with a touch of austin powers esquire cheese here and there it was labeled by many critics to have been a great parody or unintentional comedy unintentional is the word this movie was never intended to be humorous witty yes but not humorous unfortunately it's witless rather than witty with this new m4tv mini series you get much more story character development of your lead solid portrayals and a fine even entertaining blend this story is a bit long much longer than its predecessors but deservedly so as this version carries a real storyline and not just action and eye candy while it features both action and eye candy it also corrects the mistake made in the 1985 version by forgetting ij all together and going back to the source materials for aq making for a fine well thought out plot and some nice complementing sub plots now this attempt is not the all out action extravaganza that is indiana jones nor is it a poor attempt to be so this vehicle is plot and character driven and is a beautiful rendition of the aq ksm saga filmed on location in south africa the audience is granted beautiful if desolate vistas sa aboriginal cultures and some nice wildlife footage to blend smoothly with the performances and storyline here steve boyum totally surprised me with this one as i have never been one to subscribe to his vision in fact i have disliked most of his work as a director until this attempt i hope this is more a new vein of talent and less the fluke that it seems to be this version rates a 9 8 10 on the tv scale from the fiend	positive
have you heard the theory of cloning redundancy where a copy is poorer than the original caddyshack 2 is a perfect example of that they try to duplicate everything from the first movie now in a few cases this work robert stack is actually a little better than ted knight when they play essentially the same character i actually like randy quaid who is no more or less offensive than bill murray in the original but jackie mason is no rodney dangerfield and worse of all c2 demonstrated once and for all that dan ackroyd is one of the worst comedy actors of all time there is very little that i like him in and c2 nailed the coffin shut on his comedic career as far as i'm concerned he seems to feel the same sticking more to tuffy like driving miss daisy and hosting psi factor other than that it's mostly been there done that for caddyshack 2 watch the original twice rather than each version once and you'll get more for your rental money	negative
i went into this movie thinking that it would be a neat football drama in the same vein as remember the titans however i came away feeling like i had just attended a ted haggard sermon about the rapture the only thing that was missing was the request for a tithe at the end of the movie actually one would probably get more out of a televangelist sermon than this poor excuse for entertainment at least with the televangelist sermon there are quotes from the scripture rather than quotes from popularist self help pulp the plot was entirely too predictable to the point that anyone with a long enough attention span could have laid out the entire plot within the first 15 minutes of the movie	negative
well i'll be honest it is not exactly a sholay but you cant get a sholay every week in fact you could see distinct signatures of not without my daughter sally field 1991 in this movie however as most inspired movies go this one was a well inspired one well handled and well done nana patekar as usual tends to overdo his hysterics but all others are commendable specially so about dipti naval saw her after a long time but she hasn't lost any of her grace in fact she has performed much better that when i last saw her another one of the bollywood stars that seem to grow more beautiful as they age all in all a nice watch	positive
this film is cringingly bad you can tell that all the actors are embarrassed to be associated with such a truly terrible movie there are obvious budget constraints but with a little thought and attention to detail the movie could have been so much better for example check out the scene where mickey first goes to the mortuary and is talking to his friend the pathologist whilst the murdered taxi driver is lying on the slab you can actually see the corpse breathing what couldn't they afford to hire a half decent extra that could hold his breath for a 2 minute scene	negative
there's a lot the matter with helen and none of it's good shelley winters and debbie reynolds play mothers of a pair of leopold loeb like killers who move from the mid west to hollywood to escape their past reynolds a starstruck jean harlow wannabe opens a dance studio for children and winters is her piano player soon winters as helen begins to crack up it's all very slow going and although there are moments of real creepiness nasty phone calls a visit from wino timothy carey the movie is devoid of any real horror nevertheless it's still worthy entertainment the acting divas are fine and the production values are terrific a music score by david raskin cinematography by lucien ballard and oscar nominated costumes contribute mightily with this a place in the sun and lolita to her credit does anyone do crazy as well as winters directed by curtis harrington a master at this type of not quite a movie exploitation in addition to carey the oddball supporting cast includes dennis weaver agnes moorehead as a very aimee semple mcpherson like evangelist yvette vickers and micheál macliammóir the irish orson welles as hamilton starr aptly nicknamed hammy	negative
you know you're in trouble when john cassavetes is operating at half speed instead of full throttle in a movie and the incubus is a dreadful worst case scenario of a great actor going through the motions to pay the bills actually observing the hammy script and john hough's 'baroque' art direction one can hardly blame him the movie has something to do with a series of rape murders going on in a small town with a lot of supernatural hokum mixed in somehow the direction manages to suck tension and interest out of every scene and cassavetes seems visibly p o 'ed at times the incubus itself which doesn't show up until the last scene is a well done creation but it's not worth waiting for 1 10	negative
this was basically an attempt to do the same thing with batman that was done with gilligan's island in surviving gilligan's island for those of you who missed it and shame surviving gilligan's island full title surviving gilligan's island the incredibly true story of the longest three hour tour in history was a special from a few years back where bob denver gilligan dawn wells mary ann and russell johnson the professor related the story of the show's creation cancellation rediscovery rebirth along the way stories were dramatized with actors portraying the original cast and crew it was very well done it was funny well cast and came across as a genuine document of the show return to the batcave the misadventures of adam and burt is in a similar style the re telling of the history of the show the re enactments the general feel are all the same what's missing is the straightforward approach that surviving took in return adam west and burt ward both receive invitations to a car show to which they were not meant to be invited after being allowed to stay adam and burt witness the theft of the centerpiece of the show the legendary batmobile adam and burt decide to chase after it themselves leading them through clues that cause them to think about the history of the show this eventually leads to the revelation of who stole the batmobile and why choosing to use this conceit actually having a plot is the biggest letdown of this show unlike surviving return forces the viewer to follow a less interesting storyline the theft of the batmobile instead of focusing all its attention on what the audience would most be interested in the history of the show it is the historical sections that work the best the casting as in surviving is excellent jack brewer adam west and jason marsden burt ward capture the feel of the actors without looking too much like them brett rickaby frank gorshin bears a stronger resemblance to his subject but captures none of the late gorshin's charm only his characterizations other actors' portrayals are short and functional with none standing out as especially good or bad many of the stories have been told before but they mostly play out amusingly with only the occasional clunky presentation another wonderful bit from the historical sections was the use of audition footage of lyle waggoner's tryout for the part of batman the only place where the flashbacks fail is when they insert obviously made up plot points to advance the main story this downgrades the accuracy of the flashbacks needlessly the main plot if that is what we must call it is of course ludicrous this is not really a fault in and of itself but it's just not carried off well enough to cover up the shortfall strong performances and good writing can make up for a silly plot especially in these kinds of things but we really get neither here the performances by west and ward seem somewhat flat even for them the dialog too carefully written for it to feel natural again i think the comparison to surviving gilligan's island can be seen in that the dialog is mostly just there to set up a flashback in surviving that's all it intends to be in return it tries to do double duty and unfortunately often fails gorshin and newmar do well although i agree with others that gorshin had not aged well and that newmar had and what's waggoner taking to look that good but aren't given enough to do again i think they all would have been better served by a more straightforward presentation than the one chosen here another odd point about return this special is about the batman tv series and its history yet all the clips shown are from the theatrical movie even the waggoner footage is technically movie footage if you know you're bat history then you know that the movie was originally planned to be made first only to be delayed in favor of the tv show when cbs needed to fill time fast so when waggoner and west were testing for the role it was for the movie not the tv show why return only uses movie footage is unclear it most probably has to do with rights issues but it is a distinct distraction to those in the know seeing julie newmar in the present but only footage of lee meriwether as catwoman in the past overall i liked the show mainly for the flashbacks i would have preferred the style used in surviving gilligan's island but i can understand why they'd want a more story oriented piece given the subject matter besides i like these people it's nice to see them out and about still having fun with one of the great pieces of entertainment history i just wish they had done it a little better and when more of the original cast was still alive to be there	positive
i gave this a 2 and it only avoided a 1 because of the occasional unintentional laugh the film is excruciatingly boring and incredibly cheap it's even worse if you know anything at all about the fantastic four	negative
an excellent depiction of one of the more unwholesome aspects of that era i loved the visuals very fitting for a story connected to a graphic novel i thought tom hanks was really great in this he came across very well as someone who has been hardened by his work which he didn't fully choose for himself but still wants to have a normal life for his family he does the best he can to see that happen don't want to spoil the plot but you have to see this movie if you are a person who wants more from a movie than the usual shoot 'em up action gangster format it is violent though	positive
one of the great classic comedies not a slapstick comedy not a heavy drama a fun satirical film a buyers beware guide to a new home filled with great characters all of whom cary grant is convinced are out to fleece him in the building of a dream home a great look at life in the late 40's	positive
before miracle on 34th street maureen o'hara and john payne made this this this film i was going to describe it but can't find words for how badly this film turned out the subject matter of adopting a child and maureen's illness are both very serious and sensitive issues but that notwithstanding this could have been done a whole lot better than it was it was so extreme in its portrayal that it didn't come across as real at all probably its problem started with a weak script another example of a screenwriter taking a novel and writing a weak movie see my review of a stranger in my arms the beautiful o'hara was often saddled with clunkers like this another being forbidden street britannica mews which i may review eventually if you have any emotional ties to this from childhood you'll be kinder to this rather lifeless colorless and lackluster film but for something along the lines of this maybe you can find its tv movie remake it has to be better it has to be	negative
what is cry freedom like it is simply great and unique experience about making of south africa and how black people in that country were repressed by white people main character of the story is donald woods kevin kline chief editor of the newspaper daily dispatch in south africa woods writes several articles where he speaks critically about views of steve biko denzel washington soon woods meets biko and he changes his views about him and he also begins to understand what authorities are doing to black people in south africa right from the top even from the chief of police when biko dies in police custody woods decides that he have to write book about him and that no matter what he has to publish it but woods must escape from his country to get that book published and he must also put his family on second place so world can find out the truth attenborough managed to make a good movie about people with main message that black and white are the same cause we are all people story leads us to south africa and this movie is great way for the whole world to learn what happened in that land and i'm disappointed that only 3200 people rated this movie this is movie from which we all can learn something although it is a bit long this story couldn't be presented in any shorter way because director wanted to show us how hard was for woods to get that book published after death of biko also relationship between woods and biko was shown great just like families of those two people and all the problems they are going through but sometimes sacrifices must be made biko's death so the truth could be reveled woods book	positive
sorry to disagree with you but i found the dkc series to be quite engaging so much so that i invested in the snes system and my own copies of the games this is mind you almost ten years after the initial release of dkc 1 the graphics were ground breaking for their time the first vector graphics games for home systems the music and characters are all memorable and the games brought myself and my girlfriend dozens of hours of entertainment true the second game was better than the first and the third was perhaps lacking the 'edge' of the second installment but all three offered different play and i enjoy them to this day by the way i'm old enough to remember when there were no video games whatsoever and tvs were black and white	negative
mary poppins is definitely much better but this is a lovely film nonetheless angela lansbury is splendidly dotty as engletine price and david tomlinson has great fun as mr brown their chemistry was just brilliant as well the children however just lacked the same sparkle though paul is very funny and cute the songs were actually not as bad as some people say beautiful briny sea is the best in fact all the songs are outstanding the special effects were wonderful that had plenty of magic and the story is original enough the highlights though like mary poppins were the animated sequences the underwater sequence was beautiful but my favourite was the football match which was absolutely hilarious the only other criticism was that i didn't quite get the ending when i first saw it all in all a lovely film that is hardly ever on 8 10 bethany cox	positive
to be fair i didn't see a lot of this show probably because it wasn't as good as the original m a s h but i seem to recall them moving it around on the weekly schedule some shows just aren't worth the trouble of following around every week but i really did try at first so it wasn't all bad maybe i just kept expecting it to improve but i can't give this show a 1 in all honesty i can't give it any more than a 2 either it wasn't mash i'm not going to type those stupid 's every time and it was trying to be mash without putting forth any effort like it would just magically happen well guess what no magic the best i can do here is to compare it to other shows trapper john m d was a much better show by far however they should have called it b j hunnicut m d because pernell roberts looked exactly like an older bj but nothing at all like trapper john keep everything else the same just change his name and the name of the show presto after mash wasn't the only sequel to completely bomb and dishonor the original archie bunker's place was a lame follow up to all in the family it had no heart no conflict no depth all of the things that made all in the family so memorable likewise mash was funny because the doctors were reacting to the impossible absurdity of war remove the war and you remove the drive for 99 of the humor potter can't yell at klinger for wearing a dress because klinger isn't wearing a dress because he's not trying to get kicked out of the army because he's already out of the army because the war is over breathe all of the jokes became forced because there was no motivation for anything the least motivated was the viewer to stay around and watch the show and from what i remember the whole show seemed to be potter klinger and mulcahy just standing there unnaturally facing the audience like a trio of vaudeville performers it was reminiscent of good times where they spent 90 of the show standing behind that couch and talking to the audience trying to make it look like they were having natural conversation they weren't and it felt even less natural on after mash another random tidbit i recall is that the people who made mash never got any royalties from the spin off the studio used the absurd excuse that after mash was really a spin off of the movie mash which they owned and not the tv series nice try but mulcahy was the only one of the three in the movie and he was never deaf i guess studio execs will do anything for a buck anything other than make a worthwhile sequel that is	negative
this is a very moving film that takes a new twist on somewhere we've all been a relationship as it's about to end kristen thomson's performance as tessa desperately trying to hold onto her connection with bobby for just one more day is extremely convincing and moving and takes you right into the story who hasn't been faced with the end of a relationship and at least wanted to shout out tearfully just one more night when he does give her one more night the journey that these two people share makes you pause and think about how precious every truly close relationship can be and how each one whether permanent or not should be treated with respect rather than simply thrown away	positive
dick clement and ian la frenais have a solid hit rate as far as their tv work is concerned however their film work has been much more chequered 2008's the bank job was fine the previous year's across the universe decidedly weak for instance still crazy fortunately is a solid success it has a great story excellent performances a lot of humour fabulous music and above everything else real heart i savour moments and this film has one of them just when everything is going pear shaped at the festival reunion performance hugely enjoyable	positive
this film has been on my wish list for ten years and i only recently found it on dvd when my partner's grandson was given it he watched it at and was thrilled to learn that it was about my generation born in 1930 and evacuated in 1939 and he wanted to know more about it and me luckily i borrowed it from him and watched it on my own and i cried all through it not only did it capture the emotions the class distinction the hardship and the warmth of human relationships of those years as well as the cruelties spoken and unspoken but it was accurate i am also a bit of an anorak when it comes to arp uniforms ambulances lcc in the right colour white and all the impedimenta of the management of bomb sites and the work of the heavy rescue brigades i couldn't fault any of this from my memories and the sandbagged anderson shelter and the wvs canteens brought it all back the difference between the relatively unspoiled life in the village and war torn london was also sharply presented i re lived 1939 40 and my own evacuation from london with this production i know jack gold's work of course and one would expect no more from him than this meticulous detail but it went far beyond the accurate representation of the facts and touched deep chords about human responses and the only half uttered value judgements of those years it was certainly one of the great high spots in john thaw's acting career and of gold's direction and deserves to be better known it is a magnificent film and i have already ordered a couple of copies to send to friends	positive
alfred hitchcock invented any kind of thriller you could think of he set the standards so high that any director who makes a suspense movie will be fatally compared to him the main subject of this bullock vehicle all the ideas almost everything was already in hitchcock's classic rope the two students who commit a gratuitous crime nietsche's philosophy and the clues that the boys disseminate the master was the first to transfer them to the screen and with an eighty minute movie which was a technical riveting tour de force murder by numbers does not take place in a single room like the rope mind you and what a supreme originality it pits two cops against the evil youngsters and you would never guess it these two cops are very different actually bullock plays the part of woman living like a man and her partner chaplin is as shy as a clueless girlie the two boys' performances are not really mind boggling not as good as say that of edward norton in primal fear well you know rope was so good	negative
master of italian horror dario argento is called a lot of bad things by non fans and is deserving of absolutely none of the backlash in fact every time i hear something bad about argento i think they're really talking about michele soavi he just doesn't get the same amount of attention because his films were never as successful in theaters in fact his best film 1994's cemetery man was probably his least successful or just didn't get the attention he felt it deserved because after that he left film and went into directing television he's never gone back so people really don't know how inferior his other films are because by the time they've seen them they're already fans of the italian horror aesthetic which means you have to accept the fact that they make almost zero sense and are usually very unattractive films this is where the church stands out from the pack because visually it's so cheap and ancient looking you can smell the dust but it has its' charms too though they are few the camera work is truly arresting and the music score is hugely elaborate and grand since argento is the reasons people have seen soavi's work all i don't know anyone who caught the church before argento's suspiria and deep red soavi is a bit of a hack sort of like an italian mick garris the utmost example of a director preferring style over substance the flaws of the church are constant and plenty the film opens with a somewhat interesting prologue showing knights on white horses charging through a peasant village akin to those you see in any robin hood adaptation in some long ago century these scenes are intense enough energetic and get quickly to the point then we cut to the present where the film's style takes over yeah the movie is okay to look at and for about 35 or so minutes in the present 1980's wherever italy the movie is just interesting enough to get us to the slowly revealing horror elements so now we know the purpose of the film is the build up of it's horror and it's a decent build up for the most part but as the movie approaches the halfway point we realize the movie's driving by and nothing is happening the plot is very simple i think two people working in a church one as a cataloger of books and the other as a restorer of the building's wall artwork discover a scroll scripture that the man thinks will lead them to some kind of buried treasure or priceless artifact that he can sell and get rich off of so he follows his 'map' only to uncover a force underneath the church that has him hallucinate while he's slowly becoming a demon who will make everyone else hallucinate so while he is doing his demon work someone he passed the force onto kills himself in a manner that traps everyone in the church while the demon 'contagen' spreads onto everyone leaving a black preacher and the little girl who sneaks out of the church every night to go clubbing as the only 2 people who can stop the plague from spreading beyond the church walls that probably sounds action packed and soavi's style is far more lethargic than argento but never before have i seen an attempted surrealist film this agonizingly boring i kid you not absolutely nothing happens in the entire film i've seen expressionistic or impressionistic i'm no film school super grad films before but most of them actually show things happening john carpenter's halloween for one it follows pretty closely in the footsteps of lamberto bava's demons films since argento co produced we're shown to a location where a bunch of people gather one turns into a demon all the others are isolated that person infects everyone except a couple survivors then the demons either get out infecting the world or the survivors get out when the demons die this film puts all those same elements in place except unlike argento's work nothing happens okay a few things do happen but only one bizarre sequence has the panache of lamberto's much more fun demons films a random woman's neck is impaled by a demon using a section of fence he rips out of the floor what's bizarre about that you wonder it happens in front of about two dozen people what do they do nothing she dies her head trickles blood in closeup but all those people don't even notice though it happens in plain view and no less than 8 feet away from them maybe 4 people notice the demon running up to stab anyone he can as he runs toward her so they duck out of the way she's killed and in the shot after she dies everyone is just sitting around being quiet while a boy plays a saxophone i kid you not that's what happens that's more than logically incoherent it's plain stupid the scene is suggesting that the woman just sort of disappears and no one saw her death they all just up and forget about it and this 15 second thing is absolutely the only event that takes place in the movie i'm not saying it's the only violence gore or murder we see it's not it's just the only thing we can tell is happening for example in one scene a beautiful woman sees herself in a mirror looking old and ugly she starts clawing the skin on her face off but when she reappears minutes later no scratches people are devoured by fish and their faces are squashed by subway cars but later they turn up as totally unharmed members of a possessed cult in a scene that commits the ultimate horror heresy copying a famous scene from roman polanski's 1968 masterpiece rosemary's baby the greatest horror film ever made shot for shot even if argento did that i would be furious	negative
death machines takes a fairly decent premise for an action movie unstoppable martial arts killing machines sent out to eliminate a crime boss' opponents and turns it into an unwatchable mess i have rarely seen such a breath taking combination of tiny budget bad acting and incoherent script released as a so called movie it's easily the worst martial arts action oriented movie i've seen in years eclipsing even ninja holocaust which at least had some good energetic fight scenes the actual star of the movie is the white death machine it's basically his vehicle so he is featured prominently in many more scenes than his two cohorts he's in good shape and he's not bad looking but as an actor he's barely there think chuck norris in the octagon only without any energy or emotion this is obviously a deliberate choice on the part of the actor and director but you have to be arnold to pull this kind of thing off and this guy is no arnold the movie and the director can't seem to find the time or the budget to film the scenes that would have answered the basic questions that it originally posed like who was the shadowy figure giving the marbled mouthed asian lady her orders how did the gang war end why did the mush mouthed asian lady decide to have her zombie assassins killed and what the heck happened that left her assistant dead and her wielding a katana like a broom stick it does however find the time to film a completely extraneous bar fight in which a sailor well he looked like popeye destroys a bar because the juke box didn't work it's only related to the rest of the film because in the process he also k o 's the movie's hero a bartender karate student who was a victim of the death machines first major assignment he got his hand chopped off while they were killing his teacher it follows this up with one of the most un called for love scenes between the hero and his girlfriend i have ever watched the segue makes no sense at the end of the bar fight she's grimacing over his splayed limp body and the next thing they are in a tasteful shadow montage of sex and love that looks like it came from a hallmark card btw we never see the sailor again and wait until you see the showdown between the homicide detective and his captain it plays as if the director and screenwriter never actually saw a movie scene placed inside a police station but had heard of them second hand and decided to include some without really knowing how they worked the movie is a textbook case of poor casting and community theater level actors floundering without decent direction the three death machines come across as clods the hero knows his lines but can't carry the movie given that his character is an ineffective wimp his girlfriend is a charisma vacuum and all the other minor parts are barely watchable all this makes for a fairly poor movie but the dragon lady does more to drag the movie into subterranean stinker territory than anyone or anything else she looks ridiculous her tiny inexpressive face is overpowered by her ton o hair skyscraper wig she wears her red silk dress like a bathrobe and she talks with a terrible mush mouth delivery that screams needed time with a dialog coach poor lady she was obviously way out of her element and as far as i know never appeared in a film again add to this a low budget one synthesizer soundtrack that never shuts up and never plays anything appropriate or interesting crappy film stock and lighting fight choreography that is strictly from hunger and a general all around dreariness and lack of energy in the blocking and the stage business and you have one lame movie i got this as part of a 50 movie dvd compilation so it probably cost me about 50 cents to watch it it wasn't worth it feh	negative
i watched this movie for the first time ever on the sci fi channel and i must say it was simply awesome for those of you whom loves 'the never ending story' this is one that would bring back memories of that movie even though it is a 1996 movie it has a hazy like setting and look which makes it feel like it is a fantasy the acting was brilliant and the music was great especially the beginning battle song and end song to those of you who have yet to see it watch it i recommended completely	positive
i almost did not go see this movie because i remember march of the penguin was not that much exciting i went mainly because disney promised to plant a tree if i go see it on the opening weekend but after i did go see it it was simply amazing the fact that the photographers can capture impossible images are simply worth your money you also get to see different habitats different vegetation animals and natural phenomenons that will not only shock you simply because you would never expect nature to be so magical and dynamic but also touch your souls and raise the question of humanity versus the world of how our lives have deviated from nature to such a degree that we take for granted of the natural beauty and miracles that are quintessential to our biosphere you don't have to be an earth lover or a tree hugging environmentalist to appreciate the mere awesomeness of this documentary you simply have to be a curious soul who questions the value and miracle of living enjoy	positive
a small town schoolteacher geena davis slowly begins to realize that she has suffered amnesia and really use to be a secret government assassin soon there are men after her and a small time private detective samuel l jackson this was action packed with some great special effects and really funny one liners especially from jackson although the action may get a little silly at times who cares after all aren't movies meant to be a good time craig bierko is fun as a ruthless villain the movie itself was an all around good time just don't expect to have to think too much about it because then if you take it too seriously then the movie actually won't be fun but stupid instead this movie doesn't deserve to be called stupid or any other bad name	positive
what a sad sight these tv stalwarts make running out the clock on their careers stumbling about a little rusting hulk of a ship boat might be more appropriate the whole production feels cheap and shabby and it's not helped by a big name star who is barely capable of spitting out the few lines that he's given in a credible fashion at no time do the supporting cast rise above the material they're clearly watching the clock here bang out the scenes get the pay cheque go home and try to forget all about it it's not particularly badly scripted or filmed there are no real clangers it's just utterly anodyne and shot in a very limited number of cramped sets with a small cast of extras the pacing is a little bizarre an embarrassingly tentative romantic sub plot is only begun after the main action starts which makes it feel irrelevant maiden voyage scores a couple of points for being competently scored and for being a fun game of spot the kiwi bit parters most of the cast are graduates of shortland street or xena warrior princess the saddest thing about this production is that this film probably constitutes their big break	negative
ignore the bad reviews on here this film is awesome just before dawn is a great example of what can be done in a film with a minimal budget if you have a dedicated crew decent script and a cool idea for a film it's a hell of a lot of fun i enjoyed it a lot more than most other 80's slashers because the killer is so unique wrong turn ripped this movie off something fierce there's plenty of blood and scares my girlfriend was freaked out and she watches almost everything with me and doesn't flinch it's got that creepiness to it i'd say that just before dawn is the best early 80's slasher out there i really enjoyed it 8 out of 10 kids	positive
i have to say this this is the first movie i'm reviewing on here i didn't finish watching i mean i couldn t continue no matter how adamant i am for watching things until the bitter end 'the ballad of the sad café' proved no match to this viewer vanessa redgrave stars as the strange woman in town who does things like walk through the river with a full set of clothes on anyways a long lost relative comes to visit he's a midget and well that's as far as i got what the heck was the point of all of this i didn't even bother to wait for michael carradine to come on as i was already pummeled senseless by the combination of the slow script and having to deal with a midget in a dramatic role i call this coffee table cinema the type of cinema that appeals to just a scant few of you but the others just stay away	negative
the idea's which are shown in this film are with a lot of care and detail and depict what a lot of people from around the world think of the american policies not neccessarily the united states itself it shows what most of the people around the world think about america and what the americans dont know about themselves 11 directors showing 11 amazing minutes each of something which will give us viewers a lot to think about when they go home after watching the movie	positive
i also made the mistake of thinking that i was going to see the 2003 swimming upstream with geoffry rush this was worse then a lot of student films that i have seen the script was forced the acting was subpar and the editing annoying it was so slow that i just managed to force myself into staying but i always give a movie a chance so i suffered until the very end apparently there was a memo out about this movie because my friend and i were the only ones in the theater why didn't somebody send me this memo that is why i'm posting as a warning to others thinking of shelling out good money to see this i just hope that you actually got to this page and didn't get trapped like i did by looking at the wrong swimming upstream p s sorry to the cast and crew if you are reading this i know that you worked hard to make this i know what goes into making a movie keep trying	negative
well well well as good as john carpenter's season 1 outing in masters of horror was this is the complete opposite he certainly proved he was still a master of horror with cigarette burns but pro life is perhaps the worst i have seen from him it's stupid totally devoid of creepy atmosphere and tension and it overstays it's welcome despite the less than an hour running time the script is nonsense the characters are irritable and un appealing and the conclusion is beyond absurd and for those suckers who actually bought the dvd one of them being me did you see how carpenter describes the film he's actually proud of it and he talks about it as his best work for a long time and he praises the script and in the commentary track where he notices an obvious screw up that made it to the final cut he just says he didn't feel it essential to rectify the mistake and he just let it be there i fear the old master has completely lost his touch i sincerely hope i'm proved wrong i want to leave on a positive note and mention that the creature effects are awesome though technically speaking this film is top notch with effective lighting schemes and make up effects	negative
david duchovny and michelle forbes play a young journalist couple who want to go to california but can't really afford to so they 'ride share with another young couple brad pitt and juliette lewis to save on expenses the idea is for them to stop at various murder sites along the way sites where serial killers did their thing since brian duchovny is a writer and carrie forbes is his photographer what they don't know is that pitt earley and lewis are serial killer and girlfriend who just goes along with whatever he says i don't care for pitt as a rule but he does justice to psycho roles the scary thing is that he does them so well i've actually known people like him before no not killers but with pretty much the same mindset anyway as the road trip goes along carrie guesses that the others are about out of money but earley seems to always come up with the cash somehow never mind that he leaves someone dead here and there to do it though lewis does her role well one that she excels at a not too bright waif that has a good heart but doesn't understand that she doesn't have to put up with being beaten up by earley when she does something he doesn't like as things begin to get more unacceptable carrie insists that the other couple be put out at a gas station and unfortunately it's at that point where she's inside that she sees a news bulletin that tells her exactly who they've been ride sharing with after which things go downhill for them at a rapid clip this is not the greatest flick in the world but it's not bad i watched what was supposed to be the 'unrated' version but i wonder how much was cut out of the rated version because this seemed fairly tame to me really not that this makes it family fare or anything unless it's maybe the manson family 7 out of 10	positive
sometimes it is difficult to watch films with subtitles in this case danish but the watching is worth it as the story progresses the reasoning for the choice of two sisters to take care of their father is questionable but their society is different their choice leaves them alone until a french woman comes there may be a question on why the french woman came to their place to stay and this is never fully developed the feast which happens later as a result of unexpected funds from france is a source of unusual pleasure to all who attend and something they have not experienced before it provides a fitting thank you for the kindnesses given to the guest filmed with a dark aura and the display of poverty it is a beautiful experience for the viewer	positive
never have i seen a movie like this didn't plan on seeing it but it was worth the turn of the tv channel i am mostly a scifi movie watcher but i would be more than happy to add this one to my collection it starts out as a one sided film with a simple love triangle then became something a little different can't tell more then that but it does involve two guys and one girl juts not the way you would expect also this movie starred hugo weaving from the matrix and the lord of the rings in a role i would not have expected very funny guy this movie is playing on here tv but if you do not have satellite it is worth a rent so give it a try you won't be disappointed	positive
folks is a comedy about a man whose parents beg him to kill them because they're going senile and want to be put out of their misery several times he tries to kill them and then changes his mind saving them from his death traps at the last minute and losing one of his body parts each time in the process the movie seems to hate its main character which makes it all the more painful to watch there's also the usual tacked on love interest and predictable ending this movie was also the first time i'd seen tom selleck without a mustache and i remember his shaved upper lip looking weird and making me feel slightly slick but this might have been just because of the terrible premise and lame execution of the movie	negative
recap not entirely familiar with the shakespeare story of macbeth but my wild guess is that this is pretty close to the original only set in present time it tells the story of macbeth a member of a crime syndicate in melbourne he is a valued hit man and in the favor of leader duncan but he and his lady has higher ambitions than that and plan the murder of duncan and any competition of the throne this is a story of betrayal and cold brutal death comments very interesting idea i must say to use the story but change the setting to present time but still keep the original dialog it sets a huge contrast between the classical poetic work and the violence promised to be extremely violent it is a promise that it keeps but not in the notion i imagined it is very bloody indeed but the violence is slow not just figuratively speaking that it is calculated which it is too but also literally a lot of action is actually slowed down to slow motion and that is what brings the movie to its knees what could have been a unique strength the contrast between the superfluous and poetic dialog and the extreme violence now turns into something else entirely now both slow the move down painfully much so much that it actually becomes dull and boring at times also i can't figure out the context the three witches act within set to present time and reality i figure that such magical witchcraft had no place in the movie apparently it does but to me it seems completely out of place not a subplot but a complete sub story with it's own rules completely different than the rest of the movie seems completely out of place surely it must have been possible to convert that part too to something modern drug induced hallucinations perhaps which i suspect that the director hints at but then he has left way too much witchcraft in it to be believable now they only bring stretches of the movie that is clearly beside the story and i just waited for the real movie to begin again a clear disappointment but maybe something for shakespearean buffs 4 10	negative
this movie was recently shown subtitled not dubbed on australia's special broadcasting service i thought i read here that there is sometimes an assumption that revenge of the rats is a sequel in fact the rats are getting revenge for something that is done within this movie or in human history there is no prequel as far as i know now let's get the pied piper of hamelin out of the way perhaps this tale crossed my mind when i was watching the film but that's all there was the use of the word coffers at the end of the movie a dazed mayor tries to justify her actions by saying the coffers were empty coffers isn't a word you hear around much these days unless you read folk tales to your children as i do since seeing revenge of the rats i've read two versions of the pied piper of hamelin now i see the comparison a metaphorical fat but literally ugly mayor promises more than the city can afford to get rid of the rats this is about as far as i can follow the analogy the children are not led to a door in a mountain with one lame boy left behind to tell of a land of winged horses and fountains where it is always spring and everyone is always happy there's a lot that is quite mainstream about this movie the romance and the resolution especially the female characters have potentially powerful roles in society but are really quite impotent where this film is quite rebellious as compared with american cinema is that it is anti authoritarian the helicopter pilot is sacked by the mayor for doing good the mayor and local government are portrayed as corrupt and pandering to big money finally it is left to one doctor in frankfurt to solve an epidemic of a fatal and contagious disease apparently there is no national infectious diseases authority to co ordinate things or send in back up i'm not a horror aficionado so any horror i do see is usually mingled with humour right from the rat in the blood bank you can see this is going to have the right balance of horror and comedy for most viewers the huge number of rats is impressive and the horror fans seem to be satisfied too	positive
opening scene 'explains' why hurt is later 'immune' to the 'contaminated man' too bad it doesn't explain anything else how did he get whatever he 'caught' what was it why does it work so fast then we go to present day budapest ok was the opener in the past or the future it turns out to be the past of course but for a minute it looks just as likely to be the nd of the movie moved to the beginning sorry i should have paid closer attention huh or maybe it's just badly done then a lot of confusion about the different jobs he's had in related fields and finally a mention about how he should have died from the original experiment the n s a did on him aha so the n s a and private industry got together to poison one of their top guys to watch the effects he must have been one of the top guys he's friends with the c e o of the chemical company for god sakes then there's the substance itself technically a poison but it mutates in immune 'carriers' so we can have whatever we want a poison a disease an allergic reaction all very different things in real life magically it's not contagious from one dying victim to another only from the carrier how convenient then there's the h a z m a t protocol they jump into a situation without having any idea what's in store or how prepare for it did the producers not have enough money to show a proper wash down after the crew just left the scene of a deadly unknown substance i kept thinking hurt was going to die from bad cleanup technique and the open scene would turn out to be the closer after all	negative
this is the best movie i have ever seen it has it all tragedy and happiness love and hate and a deep friendship that not even war can destroy the most splendid casting i have ever seen patrick swayze and james read were top grade in this movie if you see part 1 you will want to see it all some of my friends watched part of the movie at my home then went out and bought the movie i am a civil war buff but this movie got my grandchildren interested in history any movie that can get children to learn history is great i have books i ii iii and when the girls come up from florida each year they want to see north south	positive
'thriller' remains the greatest of the pop music promos to have a plot great visuals and a tip top song to wrap the film around michael jackson was at the top of the tree at this time and not so altered in his plastic surgery regime for it to matter here he is in good form the song is terrific he leads the zombies in dance like no other ola ray plays the girl who watches with incredulity as her sweet boyfriend jackson natch turns into a werewolf then to the pulsing rhythms of the opening line 'it's close to midnight' he stomps around the graveyard with the other zombies and creatures of the night the crowning glory of all this is the fruity voice of the great horror star vincent price speaking in the middle of the record terrific	positive
watched on hulu far too many commercials so it broke the pacing but even still it was like watching a really bad buddy movie from the early sixties dean martin and jerry lewis where both parts are played by jerry lewis if i were indian i'd protest the portrayal of all males as venal and all women as shrews they cheated for the music videos for western sales and used a lot of western models so the males could touch them i usually enjoy indian films a lot but this was a major disappointment especially for a modern indian film the story doesn't take place in india the uncle keeps referring to when mac will return to india but i can't find out where it is supposed to be happening	negative
gold raiders 1951 a dull western comedy feature with the three stooges including shemp howard at this point who i've always enjoyed as the third stooge doing their usual schtick and directed by the normally dependable edward bernds who also did some of their funniest classic shorts so one has to wonder just what went wrong this time the most probable answer is that what worked pretty good as a 15 minute two reeler comes up as too much for a 55 minute feature film unlike so many of their classic short subjects gold raiders is not worth revisiting 1 2 of	negative
jack frost 2 was a horrible terrible sadly pathetic excuse for a sequal to a great movie the original was a low budget comedy horror film about a murdered who was turned into a snowman after an accident with some toxic waste and the snowman went around murdering people and avoiding blow dryers like the plague this however was a far cry from the quality of the original it seems like this even had a lower budget because for some reason after an hour into this film i still hadn't seen the snowman some revenge he's getting if he's always in the form of ice cubes with a cheesy voice over and a little shake of the cooler he rests in to give animation to the character disappointing to no belief even for a fan of bad cinema	negative
ok the helicopter shots are fantastic and the director made good use of some of barcelona's top sights otherwise production value was blown in the first few minutes and the rest of the film felt like a movie of the week ellen pompeo was charming and fun to watch abel folk had the most depth and was very effective and william baldwin was well william baldwin he got to put his martial art training to good use and be a running jumping earnest action figure the rest of the cast was wooden at best but mostly paper so if you're nostalgic about spain it's a picture postcard with an action twist and a healthy dose of el greco if not skip it	negative
some of the posters seem less than gruntled because this is neither mark twain nor rodgers and hart but clearly it doesn't pretend to be either you'll look a long time to find a greater rodgers and hart fan than me but burke and van heusen weren't exactly chopped liver in addition to which they knew der bingle inside out and tailored some great songs but beautiful moonlight becomes you it's always you the day after forever etc to fit his highly personal style and here they come up with yet another fine and unfairly neglected ballad once and for always plus a couple of upbeat philosophy lite entries in if you stub your toe on the moon and busy doing nothing the flimsy plot isn't meant to be taken seriously why else make merlin a heavy when in most if not all of the other versions he is more a friend mentor to arthur so if you start wondering aloud why sir lancelot who has been sold to historians as the epitome of chivalry and uprightness metamorphoses into a schoolyard bully you're not going to get much fun out of what is essentially a fun movie on balance it does what it sets out to do entertain so good luck to it	positive
this movie is a cyborg in and of itself half nonsense half lifetime original movie as a cyborg this movie has but one objective to make you wish that you had spent the duration of the film in a dark room punching yourself in the testicles unlike many people i did not rent this movie because of angelina jolie i'll explain why i rented it shortly i am not a big fan of ms jolie's though i will say that her performance was stellar her blank stare and robotic acting really did have me believing that she was an android hooker if anyone has a clip of her on 'inside the actor's studio' explaining how she prepared for this role please send it my way i'll make sure to use it when i try james lipton for crimes against integrity so what drove me to rent this movie one would think that it was the hope of seeing angelina jolie's nipples but it wasn't no the reason behind this rental rested solely on one of the images on the cover of the dvd that of jack palance's face half of his face was robotic when i saw that i imagined legions of palances slowly marching through a fiery wasteland laying waste to any humans that were foolish enough to resist in my mind's eye every member of this unholy army of palances had a red glowing eye a red glowing eye that looked at humans and saw only meat they were to be the architects of oblivion a cold steely apocalypse a nightmare from which humanity would never awaken it's a beautiful image that i will cherish till the end of my years like most things in my life the actual movie did not live up to my expectations no there was only 'one' jack palance and the only visible cybernetic enhancements that he had were located on his legs sadly those enhancements didn't really enhance anything that is unless you count walking like a polio victim as a super power at least their was a scene where jack grinning like a trigger happy alzheimer's patient got to shoot the hell out of some people i was waiting for him to yell i'm damn tired of paying too much for prescription medication unfortunately any outbursts of geriatric rage were few and far between what the movie did have an abundance of was a poorly developed love story about a man elias koteas a k a poor man's de niro and a cyborg angelina jolie a k a demon spawn of john voigt oh man can the love between a romeo of flesh and a juliet of silicon ever be able to last it can if you follow jack palance's simple advice you have to taste each other's time yeah i'm not sure what that means however i am sure that i do not want jack palance to be the one to explain it to me i sure as heck don't want him to show me as an experiment i suggest that you ask your significant other if he she thinks that we have reached a level in our relationship where we can begin to taste each other's time	negative
love in limbo is my all time favoirite movie set in w a it is hilairious and has an excellent cast including a group of three gorgeous actors russell crowe as arthur back in the day when he actually looked hot with short hair and no facial hair aden young barry mcjannet and craig adams as ken riddle ken is a senior high school student obsessed with sex and becomes expelled for selling pornographic drawings to his classmates he starts a new job at his uncles clothing factory and becomes close with another new guy barry mcjannet who buys a car so that they can go out and pick up chicks they become mates with the goody twoshoes geek arthur baskin crowe and the three guys drive up to kalgoorlie to vsit a brothel and lose their virginity watch it its a classic for so long i have been trying to get a hold of a dvd or soundtrack anyone let me know if you've got em	positive
i really enjoyed this movie the script is fresh and unpredictable and the acting is outstanding it is a down to earth movie with characters one cares about it brought tears into my eyes a few times but left me with a great feeling afterwards	positive
not exactly my genre this straight to dvd street fight action is one i only encountered due to a friend putting it on whilst we had a few beers i'm relatively open minded and quite a fan of eamonn walker so i sat back ready to enjoy myself blood and bone is the story of isiah bone an ex con who becomes a street fighter for unclear reasons which eventually unfold as the film progresses blah blah blah what a tedious film i understand that films like this don't rely hugely on plot but do they have to stuff in such a silly predictable and entirely stupid storyline it may not be important but by golly gum does it annoy me better no plot and pure action than a clíche ridden fleabag mongrel of a narrative infused with entirely unfounded and unachieving sentimental drivel it is the cinematic equivalent of a thin skinned turkey stuffed with rotten innards i should probably at this point mention what is of course the film's drawing point the fighting even in itself the fighting is rather poor bone manages to take out well established tough man street fighters in single punches a large oaf or two is the filmmakers' laughworthy attempt to rectify this inconsistency fighters who never seem to conclude that attacking one by one is a foolish ploy even this is repetitive and stupid arms broken and faces kicked with a steady alacrity that we get to see time and time again a run of the mill film by numbers movie which fully deserves its straight to dvd status doing absolutely nothing new and everything we've seen time and time again and not even particularly well	negative
the french naudet brothers did something nobody else did they had a video camera the day that this tragedy happened they were in building 2 when you could see papers drifting down people hitting the ground from jumping from such a height i mean it goes as far as when both buildings collapsed they went running their camera was still running when the white dust covered them they found a shop doorway and got inside but all this footage is real and i think they did a fantastic job of capturing it for us ten stars goes to the naudet brothers that filmed this extraordinary film that i watch every 9 11 so i'll never forget what this country went through i believe if i remember right it shows the first death of the priest of the firefighters while he was being carried to the church and his honorable funeral	positive
this movie is about basically human relations and the interaction between them the main character is an old lady who at the twilight of her life starts a journey to her past doing an analysis of how she lived her life this journey is precipitated because of the sons economic crisis and his intentions to put her in a nursing home it is a very honest look to some issues that we all ask ourselves at some point in life and there is plenty of secondary ideas to discuss in this movie such as family legacy real love marriage or destiny although this type of movie melodramas are nothing new this one can be useful to watch it with family members to discuss some ideas there is a good performance by the actors and the characters are very believable but because of the time some characters are maybe not fully developed i really recommend this movie for a quiet saturday afternoon	positive
this has to be one of the all time greatest horror movies charles band made the best movie of 96' in this little seen gem highly realistic and incredibly stylised with a visual flair david fincher would envy its not hard to see why band went on to make such classics as 'killjoy 2 deliverance from evil' 'the regina pierce affair' 'virgins of sherwood forest' and 'timegate tales of the saddle tramps' with a highly sophisticated story a tiny body with a large head controls a family of weirdos who perform experiments on naked women this movie may be a bit too much for younger viewers and is only for the most educated type of viewer but for those who see it band is able to convey subtle messages about the human condition through his masterpiece the head is symbolic of the lost love and longing for one's inner self that we all must face at one point or another and for this reason i was able to engage with this film on a deeply personal level although many earlier critics have compared band's film to re animator and other lesser works this stands head and heels above the rest it is gorier but not pointlessly the gore in this film is well crafted and used to enhance the storyline rather than to just get a cheap shriek out of the audience also the special effects in this film are absolutely top notch easily the best work done in a horror film since well ever the work in this film makes savini's effects look like the work of a blind limbless hobo the only problem i have with this film is the copious amounts of full frontal nudity which were ultimately unnecessary in achieving the composer's goal to create a timeless epic that would forever go down in history as possibly the greatest film of all time if it were not for this slight problem i would have given this film a perfect 10	negative
sure the history in this movie was hollywoodized but it's far from being the only bit of history rewritten for the masses lafitte sided with the americans because he considered himself a frenchman and therefore hated the british not because of any sense of patriotism for a nation that had taken over new orleans only a short time ago he broke his agreement and returned to smuggling which caused his sailing to galveston he was more of a petty criminal and scoundrel than a hero or a swashbuckler but who cares this is one movie that's sheer entertainment and face it we all wanted jean to go for the feisty wench rather than the prudish daughter of the governor brynner once again rises over mediocre writing to give a fascinating performance	positive
you can do a lot with a little cash blair witch proved that this film supports it it is no more than a sitcom in length and complexity however because it has john cleese as sherlock holmes it manages to be hilarious even on a budget that couldn't afford a shoestring the highlight of this film is arthur lowe as the sincere bumbling watson his dimness and slowness foils cleese's quick tempered wit if you ever run across the film watch it for a quirky laugh or two	positive
i watched this movie really late last night and usually if it's late then i'm pretty forgiving of movies although i tried i just could not stand this movie at all it kept getting worse and worse as the movie went on although i know it's suppose to be a comedy but i didn't find it very funny it was also an especially unrealistic and jaded portrayal of rural life in case this is what any of you think country life is like it's definitely not i do have to agree that some of the guy cast members were cute but the french guy was really fake i do have to agree that it tried to have a good lesson in the story but overall my recommendation is that no one over 8 watch it it's just too annoying	negative
cowboys and indians is an excellent film the writing acting directing could not have been better this was a story that begged to be told and this group of talented individuals and teams did a superb job of doing so stories like this one are not pleasant ones but serve to remind people of the social injustices that exist all around the world it is my hope that when this film is seen that attitudes and prejudices will be changed a film that can do that is a rare a special thing andrew berzins is an excellent writer and his talents and expertise in this field came shining through in this film thank you for telling this story ruby	positive
i really enjoyed watching hell to pay i've been a fan of westerns for as long as i can remember and this one reminded me of a lot of the westerns from the 1960s even though i was too young to have seen them in their first run the one thing that bothered me about the movie was the constant music it was distracting at times one thing i did notice and i wonder how many other fans of gunsmoke noticed was the name of buck taylor's character it was a play on doc adams' name from gunsmoke instead of gaylan adams buck taylor used adam galen i wonder if that was his choice or chris mcintyre's anyway i would recommend this movie to fans of westerns don't expect anything too deep just plain old entertainment	positive
yes this show had a lot of male frontal nudity and yes over the years the plot lines became over the top melodramatic and very unrealistic however it didn't matter because the show is great you really get involved in the characters and every character no matter how minor or major is perfectly cast i can't imagine anyone else except jk simmons play the neo nazi racist rapist leader nor anyone else playing tobias beecher except lee tergesen the transformation of his character from season 1 to season 2 is amazing however the character that made oz oz was chris keller played by christopher meloni he didn't have relations with anyone else in prison except beecher well except ronnie barlog but that was only to get ronnie to stop playing around with keller's lover boy beecher their relationship transcended sexes and tom fontana actually made us care about those two and want those two to be together i loved vern's soft spot for his kids in the show and how fontana made sympathetic characters out of all these heinous criminals that we grew to adore even simon adebesi however some plot lines were totally unbelievable and unrealistic a guy building a bomb in oz guys standing in a spotlight in their windows in their pods looking at other men plotting something in their mind too over the top drugs getting in oz everyone in the rehab group used or sold drugs and sister pete never helped anyone in six years people getting killed in the gym supply closet and kitchen no one hurting ryan's mom no one fighting cyril outside the boxing ring except vern of course two inmates with tools being left alone in the elevator shaft and one of them dying with no investigation karl metzger guard gets killed and no one investigates governor holds all his press conferences at the prison all an inmate needs to do is say i want to see glenn or i want to see mcmanus and they are taken to them no questions asked people die every week in oz on the outside people kill someone and get 20 years up for parole in eight but if they kill someone on the inside they go to death row almost immediately there is no on site paid staff in the kitchen or mail room inmates run both departments no questions asked aging drugs for inmates to substitute as time served ryan has no friends or associates but he never gets hurt killed maimed raped or beaten the guys never flush the toilets when they go to the bathroom or throw up an nba scout comes to the prison to recruit for an nba player yeah right however with all these flaws this show is still awesome it's gruesome brutal sexy edgy raw and innovative dean winters scott william winters jk simmons christopher meloni luiz guzman adele the guy that played simon adebisi eammon walker lee tergesen terry kinney mums male alexander ll cool j etc etc etc all are awesome and made the show worth watching i highly recommend renting this on dvd season six comes out 9 06 next month first five seasons are on dvd watch them and then watch them again with audio commentary i loved the director's commentary with chazz palmentari the sequence with andy schillinger running down the cafeteria tables and then falling into the hole was an awesome top notch shot kudos and kathy bates directing family business and the famous wrestling scene between beecher and keller simply amazing brilliant that'd have to be so weird for meloni to touch tergesen's private part in front of an icon like kathy bates in that one scene wow pulled that off beautifully pun intended i'm waiting for oz the next generation like with star trek etc c'mon let's get it started	positive
it occurred to me while watching imaginary heroes that any screenwriter attempting to make a drama about family relationships should seriously consider killing off a kid or two in the opening reel as a way of getting his characters to open up and reveal themselves there must be something to this storyline for it seems as if every other family drama that comes down the pike uses this device in one form or another paradise and moonlight mile are just two of the more recent examples that spring immediately to mind although one could reach back to a golden oldie like who's afraid of virginia woolf to make the point as well it's not that the death of a child is an illegitimate subject for serious films to explore far from it it's just that like any topic it can be so overused that it becomes just another movie cliché a convenient bit of narrative shorthand to get the ball rolling and to give the characters something to grapple with for the remainder of the time we get to spend with them the latest such work is imaginary heroes a film that borrows heavily from what is one of the earliest and perhaps best known examples of the family coping with the death of a child genre the academy award winning ordinary people like the characters in that earlier film the travises seem on the surface to be the ideal suburban family until one fateful day their oldest son matt who is the golden boy athlete and thus the apple of his father's eye kills himself with no explanation one minor difference is that the son in ordinary people dies as a result of an accident not a suicide it is matt's younger brother tim who winds up finding the body and who assumes the role of protagonist in the film each of the remaining family members copes with the tragedy in his or her own way matt who has always lived in the shadow of his older brother becomes more and more estranged from the father who has virtually ignored him all his life and begins to turn to drugs for surcease ben the father becomes swallowed up in feelings of remorse and guilt turning away from both his job and his family his wife sandy is the most complex character in the film a free spirited child of the '60's who feels oddly adrift in the role of mother and wife as she endures a basically loveless marriage in sterile suburbia she spends most of her time after the tragedy trying to reconnect with her pot smoking past as written and directed by dan harris imaginary heroes emerges as a wildly uneven film for every scene that feels real and authentic there is another that comes across as arbitrary and inauthentic one sometimes has the sense that harris would like to cram every possible life situation he can think of into his screenplay an admirable goal perhaps but one that makes the film unnecessarily melodramatic in the process instead of identifying with the characters and being caught up in their plight we often find ourselves thinking oh come now what next for teen suicide is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the hot button topics covered in this film the screenplay also touches on drug and alcohol abuse physical abuse sexual identity conflict life threatening illness even inadvertent gay incest it is this everything but the kitchen sink mentality in the writing that robs the movie of much of the credibility it needs to really make us care that is not to say that imaginary heroes is a bad or unrewarding film much of what it has to say about familial relationships and values in the 21st century is insightful original pointed and profound prime credit for its success goes to the actors emile hirsch sigourney weaver and jeff daniels who deliver incisive sensitive performances in their respective roles it is they who triumph over the narrative excesses to stimulate our brains and touch our hearts moreover harris in his direction achieves an effectively melancholic tone throughout but one that is frequently augmented by some badly needed flashes of daring dark comedy imaginary heroes may appear unfocused and derivative at times but its fine performances and subtle mood shifts make it a film worth watching	positive
alone in the dark is one of my favorite role playing games of all time i remember spending whole nights facing the pc screen trying to escape that mansion and actually being startled at times when monsters came surprisingly charging in now mind you i am weary of computer game generated movies i don't remember a single success story in this new hollywood genre although some are entertaining enough to be watchable and yet i am such a big fan of the game that i couldn't resist my rationale was that if the movie had a plot that so much as resembled the game's it would be ok man those were 90 minutes which seemed like 300 of my life that i'll never get back if i had that chance i would have gladly spent them rearranging my sock drawer instead this isn't even in the so bad it's funny category you would think even christian slater had a bit more sense than joining this stink bomb now tara reid i'm not complaining about her presence however if the purpose of putting this chick in a starring role is to have a sex scene which i totally understand and support hey i'm a guy i've seen more of her body on press conferences there is no plot to speak of won't waste your time pitching it to you the credibility of the story sinks below 'i did not have sex with ms lewinski' the acting is but a few notches above 'street fighter' which by the way being one of the worst movies i've seen i would recommend over this one kids i recommend the video game it has far better story acting and much more thrills as for the movie here's a spoiler it stinks wait for the porno version	negative
from the start you know how this movie will end it's so full of clichés your typical nra member will not even like this movie i give it 2 out of 10 only because of the acting of william benton i can't believe people voted 6 for this movie it's so biased towards a 'certain point of view' once a thief people aren't born bad neither are they born good they are born with a clean slate it's society parents and education what makes them who they are and if they take the wrong turn somewhere down the line it certainly isn't going to be the american penal system that gets them back on track anyway avoid this movie like the plague i bet you have better things to do with your time than waste it on this piece of crap	negative

this movie is based on a play and is the second adaptation of this work paul sorvino plays the basketball coach of a team of players that against all odds took home the championship 20 years ago they have all met for a reunion terry kinney plays james a junior high principal and will quickly get on your nerves with all his whining and feel sorry for me role vincent d'onofrio as phil plays an obnoxious businessman with just the right amount of money cockiness tony shalhoub is george the current mayor of the town and appears to be on the verge of some sort of breakdown gary sinise plays tom a writer turned alcoholic and in my opinion is excellent in the role while they are all suppose to be celebrating their championship conflicts jealousy and fighting abound as the men come to terms with what was and is now they are forced to look at their lives in a non pleasant way it's unusual to have a group of men talking and crying about what could have been and i found it interesting watching them relate to each other it's not the best movie i've seen but it's certainly good enough for a viewing	positive
the very first time i heard of latter days was when i was renting dvd's and i was interested as i am a member of the lds church i found this movie very heartfelt and in several areas it made me cry the reason for this is that too many years ago i knew a young man who went through what aaron played by steve sandvoss does in latter days but unlike aaron this dear young man did not survive the ordeal he ended up taking is life after his church his friends and his family disowned him because he was gay there have been many people who do not think that the things that are shown in the movie really happen in this day and age but the sorry and sad thing is they do for those of you out their who are gay and young you need to see this movie and if you are a gay mormon you really need to see this movie plus if you get the dvd there is help for you listed in the dvd teenage suicide in the gay world is very disturbing and this movie touches it but that part is hidden to a degree the acting and the music is excellent this movie sold out every movie house that it showed but it only showed in major cities and had a very limited release so for those who would like to see this movie i would recommend the dvd release the only people that i know who did not like the movie are members of my own church and they did not see the movie because of the subject matter gays and the lds church see the movie experience the story and feel the emotions that are showcased in this movie you i feel will not be disappointed	positive
the end of suburbia is an important documentary about modern dependence on cheap energy and the coming peak in world oil production the film is an excellent introduction to the peak oil phenomenon and includes interviews with experts like adviser to vice president dick cheney's 2001 energy task force mathew simmons author richard heinberg powerdown options and actions for a post carbon world and author michael t klare blood and oil the dangers and consequences of america's growing dependency on imported petroleum economic growth is predicated upon more electricity electricity is predicated on hydro carbon energy period and mathew simmons made a very clear statement he said future growth is not possible and for a guy from his background to say that was one of the most that's like the catholic church saying the earth is round before galileo michael c ruppert the peak has happened and now instead of being prophets we're now historians kenneth deffeyes	positive
this mini series is actually more entertaining than some others with much bigger budgets and grander aspirations sotd falls somewhere between kung fu and h r pufnstuff on the entertainment spectrum if it weren't so long nearly 3 hours i think that kids would like it quite a bit it's got adventure action cliffhanger scenes and not too much romance or other icky stuff when you're young you're not too critical of flexing rubber swords campy acting and scenes that are repeated at least two scenes are repeated identically in the movie just as was done in old time serials in order to bring the audience up to speed finally kids are usually more accepting of american english dialogue coming out of the mouths of asian actors not to mention the fact that several of the leading roles are played by non asian actors i was going to give this movie three stars but i felt like the director producers and cast deserved some extra credit for at least carrying through on the project this movie is not art but like painting your house it actually took some time effort and discipline to get it made overall not a recommended use for your time but it might keep the kids entertained while traveling in the mini van oh yeah hey imdb dialogue is the preferred and traditional spelling your spell checking seems to think that dialog is the proper spelling while dialog is acceptable both webster's and the oed consider it an alternative form	negative
style over substance but what a style it is the cell is the internal version of most serial killer movies unfortunately the story hardly supports the visuals psychotherapist catherine deane j lo goes into her patients' dreams via artificial means to discover and help them over come their phobias and obsessions a new patient whose fallen into a coma is brought to her attention by the fbi he's a serial killer who drowns his female victims then poses their bodies in grotesque scenarios like mannequins deane must enter the killer's mind and navigate through his sick fantasies in order to find and save his latest victim director tarsem singh has incredible visions and set pieces for this production each dream sequence is like a nightmare ish painting in motion from the landscapes to the costumes but the plot suffers from lack of history of its characters stargher is the only person with a thorough background and he's the last person you want to care about without him you basically have a movie that moves in the present tense only which is a shame since the movie is so visually stunning and genuinely scary lopez is wasted but she's not that amazing an actress anyway though she's as gorgeous as ever and vince vaughn i don't even know why he was chosen this is not his forte and he overacts to boot he tried too hard to become his character and it showed stick to comedy vince even so this movie is so visually frightening i still watch this movie with the lights on and can never fall asleep right away afterward	positive
spoilers ahead if you want to call them that i would almost recommend this film just so people can truly see a 1 10 where to begin we'll start from the top the story don't believe the premise the movie has nothing to do with abandoned cars and people finially understanding what the mysterious happenings are it's a draub basic go to cabin movie with no intensity or effort the screenplay i usually give credit to indie screenwriters it's hard work when you are starting out but this is crap the story is flat it leaves you emotionless the entire movie the dialogue is extremely weak and predictable boasting lines of woah you totally freaked me out and i was wondering if you'd uh if you'd like to uh would you come to the cabin with me it makes me want to rip out all my hair one strand at a time and feed it to myself the characters holy crap some have described the characters as flat i want to take it one step further and say that they actually have a reverse character arch they actually start working on a parallel universe and almost start acting backwards the actors worse than the characters are the actors they take already poor written characters and add in terrible high school drama acting the woah you totally freaked me out was said so monotone and slow like it was dumbed down i could complain for hours on the actors alone technical lighting an eight year old would be disappointed with lighting on this movie too shadowy in areas too bleached in others the director shouldn't use light as an emotion until he learns how to light a basic scene properly baby steps sound how many sound guys does it take to make a really shotty sounding movie 9 with that many sound guys this should sound amazing but quite the opposite has occured there is one scene in particular that really sticks out these guys are driving in a car and the sound of the car changes with every camera angle weak camera learn to use it anyway i'm running out of complaining space rent it i dare you rent it and learn from it give it a 1 rating it deserves it signing off amanda christmas	negative
this movie over does it on the cgi i mean sci fi really they over did it the original '' bats'' is better it does not use cgi like the sequel in this movie its the simple people running from mutated killer bats and really bats in afghanistan the plot involves u s army soldiers finding a terrorist and being attack by bats and dying _ but the reason i gave this movie 3 stars is because the way the camera zooms in on the soldiers the acting is bad and this doesn't even look like a horror movie in all this movie is a fairly good tv movie for sci fi channel but if like sci fi's movies you'll like this movie because you just like channel 43 oh and if you fall asleep during the movie don't be surprised oh sorry i think i give it 2 stars instead	negative
i really don't think producer george lucas didn't really set out to make such a horrible sequel as more american graffiti turned out to be but in retrospect it was the first crack in his then seemingly impenetrable armor coming straight off the huge success of american graffiti and produced basically at the same time as star wars this film was the first that lucas successfully took away from coppola without having to bother directing it himself the result is typical lucas far more interesting in terms of its structure and the way it's edited than the actual material the writer director bill norton has been allowed to use a variety of different screen ratios and split screens to produce odd associations in the images while it's interesting to see ironic juxtapositions of the 4 story lines the style ultimately only epitomizes the fractured nature of the film itself lucas' brilliant original film was all about a group of friends on the archetypical last big night before school ends and kurt ron dreyfuss and steve ron howard are supposed to go off to college one thing that made that film work despite the fact that it's very episodic is that you had the core characters together at the beginning and they come back together at the end there's a disposition of time like in nick ray's rebel without a cause where a certain period of time becomes very elastic and takes on more meaning than such a specific time really would in actual life but everything takes place in a static space more american graffiti is basically the opposite the space is very dynamic with toad charles martin smith off in vietnam his former girlfriend debbie candy clark partying with hippies in san francisco steve and laurie cindy williams involved in student protests in berkeley and john miler paul le mat drag racing on the semi pro circuit in a contrived meeting early in the film all the principles are brought together to watch john race but after that the threads don't come back together and weave apart the way they do in the original instead they split off and we follow the characters through about 3 years' of time just seeing various events on new years eve in what seems to be 1967 68 and 69 it's easy for the audience to become confused and i think it's fair to say that we do while the original film seemed to condense important events and rites of passages into unreal theatrical time that produced an experience of nostalgia even for those who never experienced those events this sequel drags and stretches the few plot points from the epilogue of the original and attempts to make them into a coherent film the best parts of the movie to me are the ones with candy clark in sf and charles martin smith in nam some of the jokes do fall flat but the style of those sections is interesting and they form a neat contrast with each other a good movie could maybe have been made if these parts were just a bit better and if the other parts weren't such a drag speaking of drag racing the whole plot with milner talking to a foreign exchange student was really lame unfunny and throwing in mackenzie phillips for a cameo didn't help at all it was just another contrived moment like when they briefly explain why curt isn't in the movie because he's already in canada instead laurie just has another brother who is basically identical to curt but has a different name and is now played by a very boring actor there's a black kind of satire to some of the vietnam stuff very similar to what i would imagine lucas and john milius' original idea for apocalypse now would have been like and there's some of that manic fun in the san francisco scenes that made the first movie fun but still along with that fun stuff you have the rest of the movie dragging it down as if anyone wants to see steve and laurie argue in their horrible suburban abode as if they were auditioning for a spielberg movie about divorce and child abandonment i think even if those parts of the movie weren't so painful it still wouldn't really be comparable to the first movie because there's no closure and no sense of coming back together or of anybody having learned anything it just sort of ends at the point when they ran out of money or something a cheap freeze frame imitation of two lane blacktop and so many better films like the original however this film has a great soundtrack of period hits that is probably worth owning for its own sake and almost makes the movie itself palatable the performances by country joe and the fish are great and scott glenn all duded up as a hippie in love with candy clark is a sight to see i wonder if even back then he had to use a wig i couldn't possibly recommend this movie and yet it has some small affection in my heart because i love the original so much every couple of decades i guess i have to give this movie a try just to make sure that it's really as worthless as i remember it being it's a party killer but it's something that every fan of american graffiti or george lucas in general will want to see at least once or twice it shows how a lot of effort can go into something and it can still turn out pretty half baked it makes you reflect on how much of a miracle it is that lucas actually made such a good movie as american graffiti in the first place as if all the elements were in place and all the appropriate gods had been placated unfortunately such was not the case for this film or for bill norton	negative
imagine pulling back the mask of a lethal assassin and finding barbara cartland there that's what happens with this film the opening showed promise but soon it drops all pretenses of being a thriller or even an imaginative love story and the only reason they made this story becomes abundantly clear to fill a gap in their female viewing market by creating yet another re hash of 'mis understood brooding bad boy' andrei meets 'innocent whimsical beauty' paula rather than waste any time in creating an original premise the filmmakers went straight for the money shot the bad boy being tamed by said whimsical beauty thence follows a string of insincere and heavily clichéd love scenes sprinkled with pseudo philosophical poetic fluff andrei's admission of being eponymously a 'poet' is levered in to round out the perceived qualities a byronic hero should have but even when we're told in heavy underlined writing who and what he is it's still difficult to believe it or care for a byronic hero antihero to work the story needs subtlety style and innovation all of which are utterly absent here this is not a modern day phantom of the opera it's just what happens when a weak and rather silly woman with loose knicker elastic dates a bad man who after meeting her seems as dangerous as bunny slippers the performances might have saved this film had they been any good the female lead is preoccupied with looking sexy and 'otherworldly' no matter how forced or ridiculous and poor dougray scott appears to have been drugged as he shambles through his part this is not his best work the glimmers of interest were brought by jürgen prochnow as 'vashon' and andrew lee potts as the young photographer brother a better movie would have offed the sister and kept the brother instead	negative
may be spoilers so do not read if you do not want to just like watching the tv news everything is already happened a great tsunami looms over a city bay and cut no more to see tokay suffers a large earthquake did anyone see more than the 5 seconds i saw if you want to make a love story make a love story but if you want to use a disaster movie title do please be kind enough to show me the disaster pd after watching this movie watch jishin retto or any godzilla film to satisfy the part that was willing to see people screaming and buildings collapsing that did not get a chance to do in this movie don t take me wrong i love disaster movies and i love the original nihon chimbotsu and jishin retto i even like the latest poseidon not to much of a story there but a very good and graphic disaster sequence new nihon chimbotsu looses the point as many times as pearl harbour or the day after tomorrow but at least this two movies do show good disaster sequences and also enough with the expensive fx that did not show anything give me fake buildings if you like as long as you do destroy them properly i know i must sound like a sadistic freak however i did go to see love actually when i felt like going to see a romantic film grrrrrrr even kimpachi sensei makes me cry and this movie didn t there is also a tv series called napping chimbotsu made in 1975 i have on dvd and it is much better	negative
after seeing a preview for this film at my local mall where there is a stand for purchasing foreign films i thought it looked very entertaining before watching the movie i went on to imdb to see what ratings and comments it received i was worried when i noticed the low numbers and the negative ratings despite the hype i watched to movie and to my surprise i found it unbelievable the story was great just pay attention and the characters and their relationships within the film is astonishing i haven't seen such a good combination of leading characters in long time i really felt for both characters and sensed a strong bond as reading previous posts about this movie not being epic enough or a lack of martial arts i could not disagree more this film is what it is its not braveheart and its not enter the dragon but it is still a wonderful film that does an excellent job combining story both and action while sword in the moon isn't perfect what movie is it still is wonderful and moving just wait until the ending scene with the music and cinematography together its breathtaking i only hope more people can see this movie to give it a fair voting	positive
i loved this movie it is a definite inspirational movie it fills you with pride this movie is worth the rental or worth buying it should be in everyones home best movie i have seen in a long time it will make you mad because everyone is so mean to carl brashear but in the end it gets better it is a story of romance drama action and plenty of funny lines to keep you tuned in i love a lot of the quotes i use them all the time they help keep me on task of what i want to do it shows that anyone can achieve their dreams all they have to do is work for it it is a long movie but every time i watch it i never notice that it is as long as it is i get so engrossed in it that it goes so quick i love this movie i watch it whenever i can	positive
a beautiful and touching movie that deserves a wider viewing than it is likely to get semra turan plays aicha a second generation turkish immigrant who tries to break the mold neither entirely at home with her moderately conservative muslim family nor with her liberal danish friends aicha's martial arts experience becomes a fight to find herself and have the strength to allow herself to be who she wants to be in spite of both family and friends director natasha arthy manages to balance introspection and narrative so that it has depth without becoming ponderous philosophical discourse and drawing on xian gao's choreography skills pays off in spectacular fight sequences in the end however it is semra turan's stunning debut performance that gives this movie spirit raw charisma and requisite martial arts skills are complimented by heart to make her personal drama believable well worth your while	positive
this was one of the shows that i wanted to follow up on but i'd just couldn't bring myself on devoting my time to this show to have a show that centers on the topic of politics you really need a strong plot with twists and turns to enhance the mood of the show something like the west wing or commander in chief rob lowe was ok but actors like kyle chandler just couldn't act he was awful in early edition it was a pain to sit through this show with its lack of suspense urgency and characters who can actually act i just had to give up on this show and am glad it was canceled so i would have nothing more to miss grade d	negative

i saw this once probably like most people my age 55 back in the 60's i understand the dissatisfaction with the final product by both families but this is a great movie it was a great opera but as a film it is wonderful this film should be released at least to video other generations can gain an appreciation of great music and story telling the cast was made up of some of the greatest black actors ever most have now passed away only sidney p is still with us please don't wait until he is gone and the film as all old film does becomes unusable do to the ravages of time again this is a great film which is something that one does not see very often today if at all	positive
this is one of the best films we watched in my high school spanish class if you are a fan of the opera this film will strongly entertain you of course the dancing is wonderful watching these amazing dancers moving to the music of bizet is well worth checking out	positive
this is one of those movies that make better trailers than full length feature films the concept was really cool and different the humor was unique i just felt there were missed opportunities to put the punch into this movie so many lines and gags were left hanging too long with no definite ending and really didn't leave me laughing wilson wilson farris thurman were great wanda sykes was under used in this film and needed more exposure and more opportunities to spin her character into more screen time 7 out of 10 for me more of a dvd rental also i was looking for some sort of a feel good music video during the end credits something that has become sort of a trade mark to these romantic comedy films a la something about mary meet the parents but again i was left feeling a little cheated by fact that this could have been a much better film with a little more music and punchier punch lines it felt like it was rushed into theaters	positive
rated pg 13 for violence brief sexual humor and drug content quebec rating 13 should be g canadian home video rating 14a i have seen police story a couple of times now in my opinion police story is chan's best film from the 80's he originally made it because he didn't like the other cop film he had to star in which was the protector i have not seen the protector so i cant compare the acting isn't too bad and the plot is pretty good i don't remember the plot well because i saw this film a while back but what i do remember is this film has lots of great action stunts and comedy just what a good chan film needs if you can find police story and you are chan fan then buy this film runtime 106min 9 10	positive
before barton jumps all over my remarks let's all just keep in mind that opinions are like asses we all have them i loved sigourney weaver jeff daniels i loved the dialogue and thought the acting was sublime downplayed just perfectly and understated unlike some others i did not find this all predictable i found sigourney's role refreshingly humorous and realistic especially her scene confronting the bully in the trailer i found it enjoyable and wasn't anticipating recommending this to all and sundry this is why there are different flavors of ice cream something to please everyone	positive
i collect films on super 8 and managed to snag a full length print of this one last week on e bay it looks like at least for the moment this is the only way to see this film in a country having ntsc video i have seen it available on region 2 dvd many times but never region 1 i just finished watching it a few minutes ago and i am amazed by it it's a powerful testament to freedom and finding your own place in the world the photography and music were wonderful and i really felt empathy for some of the characters i kind of like the idea that i was probably the only one in the usa watching when the north wind blows tonight long live avakum	positive
the garden of allah was one of the first feature length 3 strip technicolor films to correct a previous poster the first technicolor feature after disney's 5 year exclusivity deal was 1935's becky sharp which was a costume drama that used the color for it's garish color costumes the garden of allah looks as if it could have been shot years later as the cinematography uses not only the color but also the use of shadows it must have been amazing for an audiences at the time to see a color feature after seeing basically only black and white films for their whole life unfortunately the film does not stand up to the cinematography that being said the film is worth seeing just as a visual treat	positive
if archie bunker was armed he may well have been joe however all in the family would have had a rather short run because the censors would never have allowed it to run along the lines of this movie joe is a working class guy who is a racist and a bigot and has a big mouth especially when he's drunk one night he meets a man in a bar bill who is having a drink to soothe his frazzled nerves after accidentally killing his daughter's junkie boyfriend and he lets that slip to joe what happens is that bill's daughter was living with the junkie and she's hauled off to the hospital after an overdose and he goes by the apartment to collect her things but doesn't expect that he'll actually run into the boyfriend who comes in fresh from a big drug deal in the struggle that ensues the boyfriend is killed accidentally and bill doesn't want anyone really to know of course but he lets it slip to joe and then when the newspapers and tv reports come out joe sees them puts 2 and 2 together and suddenly this man is a hero in his eyes he hooks up with him later and bill is of course concerned that joe is going to blackmail him but not for money he wants to hang out with him which is in a way almost worse now bill's daughter escapes from the clinic she's in and slips back home and accidentally overhears what happened and then is on the run and most of the rest of the movie consists of joe bill infiltrating the underground to try to find her this builds up to a rather shocking ending which to me was totally unexpected and ends on just the right note or wrong note depending on your point of view a sort of decent but dim view of life in the early 70's mostly from a working class bigot's point of view which makes it not for everyone but it's not a bad film at all and it's a decent watch 8 out of 10	positive
martin ritt seems to be a director who was always interested in social issues as the son of immigrants he had every incentive to be so especially since he was blacklisted in the '50s conrack is based on pat conroy's novel the water is wide about his own experience in 1969 teaching a school of impoverished black children about the outside world much to the chagrin of the right wing superintendent hume cronyn what added to the movie's strength was the cultural and historical context conroy jon voight frustratedly tells another teacher how many of the children don't know about paul newman sidney poitier the vietnam war or even where vietnam is he proceeds to enlighten them about all these factors somewhere i read a complaint that when conroy played music for the children he only played white music the truth is you can't blame the movie for that it was based on conroy's real experience either way the movie's a real gem	positive
to me this movie was just plain confusing slow and uninteresting why did the aliens choose to communicate through ants it makes no sense the ending was muddled and made no sense whatsoever in the end i was hoping that the ants would kill everyone avoid this one at all costs not even mst3k could save it	negative
heather graham couldn't play a convincing lesbian if her life depended on it who do the producers of the movie think they are the absolute worst most unrealistic movie i've seen in as long as i can remember this movie is so bad that i felt compelled to sign up on imdb and make sure the rating of this film drops omg i'm heather graham i just kissed a drunk chick so while she's passed out i'm really going to pace around my room for hours asking myself frantically what have i done jesus heather get over it and grow up and i'd like to forward that same sentiment to the idiot producers and while i'm at it instead of this movie being all about an pathetic excuse for a coming out story perhaps it would have been more suitable to focus the plot onto a character who's mentally unstable like your so called lesbian character after all i know the first time i had gay sex when i left the next morning i jumped to the sky in excitement in the middle of the street honestly b tch get a grip what a joke and please note there are many many many more flaws and appallingly stupid aspects to this lame flick but i'm so sick of even thinking about it anymore bottom line if you're a smart person you'll hate this movie and if you're not a smart person then you'll love it it's as simple as that	negative
this is without a shadow of a doubt one of the scariest and most intriguing episodes of doctor who this is a thrilling psychological ride and you will probably find your own beliefs being thrown into question riddled with spine chilling moments this is an episode no who fan can afford to miss starting from when the pit was opened after the events in the impossible planet the doctor and ida are trapped and are running out of air with no other alternatives they decide to find what lies at the bottom of the pit an event which surpasses even the doctor's expectations whilst there the doctor is forced to make what he considers to be the ultimate sacrifice meanwhile rose and the other members of the planet try to find a way to fend off the ood whose minds have been poisoned by the beast also is toby zed truly cured of his possession by the beast	positive
although this movie is inaccurate overall there are some items that may be true certainly he was a wild character in his youth having played practical jokes on his fellow cadets at west point almost expelled several times graduating last in his class of 34 and often reckless in his leadership during the civil war but history may have made him a scape goat of the indian wars certainly he did his share of cruel things but how much was he under orders also there is evidence that he testified before congress at great risk to his commission and command that he argued about the fairness of breaking treaties with the indians and that if he was an indian he would also fight rather than live on a reservation as a character said in the play 1776 when asked what will be said about the british about losing the revolutionary war the character states history will do what it always does it will lie who knows how bad a man custer was certainly he wasn't the sympathetic character as portrayed by errol flynn and later by ronald reagan but i also doubt he was completely evil as he is later portrayed	negative
i was fortunate to attend the london premier of this film while i am not at all a fan of british drama i did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the bad choices they made i was in tears by the end of the film every scene was mesmerizing the attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressive i would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character spolier alert i was also hoping that dylan would have been killed by william when he had the chance end spoiler keira knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen but it was sienna miller's performance that was truly oscar worthy i am sure this production will be nominated for other awards	positive
think stage play this is worth seeing once for the performances of lionel atwill and dwight frye compare the melvyn douglas in ghost story with the melvyn douglas of this film are there vampires at loose in this 'bavarian' village or is there a more natural albeit equally sinister explanation dwight frye is herman a red herring who is cast as an especially moronic character it's fun to look at his different facial expressions in what is really a stock character not much happens for a long time but then we discover that atwill's pipe smoking doctor is the real murderer there is too much 'comic relief' but that is par for the course for this era fay wray looks really good	negative
i was lucky enough to get to see this film many years ago in england i've seen hundreds of films since but i've never forgotten this one although sinatra was playing a not very endearing character he was excellent in the role a lot of people seem to think that he did'nt really come into his own until his role in from here to eternity but in my opinion he was magnificent in concho the other role that sticks in my mind is that of william conrad i'd never see or heard of him before this film conrad plays a terrific part in this film i remember his deep and gravelly voice and he uses it beautifully to enhance the few words he speaks with a menace that sets the tone of his character also i remember the music that both introduces conrad and and seems to surround him whenever he appears an excellent film and my only disappointment was that i never ever got the chance to see it again it seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth i see in the titles that it says that the film is in black and white but when i saw it was indeed in full color i remember sinatra's blue shirt	positive
i loved it others have revealed spoilers but i won't it was an unusual premise actually sort of weird but i went along with it completely camille was a difficult part to pull off convincingly maybe that's why some people hated it but i think sienna was excellent and her acting skills enabled her to nail the part perfectly without being maudlin or ridiculous i don't know why she was even interested in a loser like james franco but married him anyway i like him as an actor and also thought he did a terrific job he has nothing to be ashamed of there have been movies with with similar setups e g ghost i simply love sienna miller and went along with the situation as written in the script i feel her great acting talent is vastly underrated and hope it becomes more recognized by the public i thought all of the actors played their parts very well and hope more people get to see the movie i highly recommend it i was surprised that my local block buster store had about 10 copies available i definitely plan to buy it	positive
this movie lacked everything story acting surprise ingenuity and a soul fifteen minutes in i was staring at the screen saying how could all of these guys get together and consider themselves friends even without the girl another fifteen minutes in i was praying for as much amanda peet as possible when a bad movie quietly rears it's ugly head eye candy is a nice consolation but there wasn't much of that cheated on all fronts	negative
not an altogether bad start for the program but what a slap in the face to real law enforcement the worst part of the series is that it attempts to bill itself as reality fare and is anything but men and women that dedicate their lives to the enforcement of laws deserve better than this what is next medical school in a minute charo performing lipo charles grodin assisting on a hip replacement c'mon show a little respect even the citizens of muncie are outing the program as staged police academy high school gym poor editing how many times can they use the car to car shot of the taco bell in the background cheesy siren effects the same loop added ad nauseum to every 'call' whether rolling code or not and last but not least more officer safety issues than you could shake a stick at if i want to see manufactured police work and wise ass fake cops i would watch reno 911	negative
first i'd like to say that while i know my share about star wars i am not a fanatic i do not know how many chromosomes a wamp rat has or the extended family of tk427 what i know is this star wars all the movies less so with episode 2 though captured something magical it's hard to say what what button lucas has found and boldly pressed but it works star wars is more than a movie it's an idea how may you ask i shall explain star wars touches on the most universal of stereotypes good vs evil it does this so obviously so profoundly that literally any person from any environment can understand episode vi does the very well concluding the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father yet also with the addition of the prequels reveals even more to the hinted back story suddenly it's darth vader at the front and viewers realize that it's the story about anakin not just luke but even before 1 3 there was amazing depth to it all it felt real as if capsule fell from the sky into lucas's lap detailing a historical account of a galaxy far far away star wars is definitely something far above the norm and i must admit whenever i see them particularly this one i feel very small i feel as though i've been thrust into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined i get a tingling feeling when i see them a feeling that something somehow has touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope	positive
george armstrong custer is known through history as an inept general who led his rgiment to their death at the battle of little big horn they died with their boots on paints a different picture of general custer in this movie he is portrayed as a flamboyant soldier whose mistakes and misdeeds are mostly ue to his love for adventure errol flynn plays george armstrong custer who we first meet as an over confident recruit at west point custer quickily distinguishes himself from other cadets as beeing a poor student who always seems to be in trouble somehow this never appears to bother custer and only seems to confuse him as he genuinely does not know how he gets into such predicaments in spite of his poor standing he eventualy graduates and becomes an officer in the united states army through an error custer receives a promotion in rank before this can be corrected he leads a union regiment into battle against the confederates his campaign is successful and custer becomes an unlikely national hero custer returns to his hometown marries his sweetheart libby who is played by olivia de havilland libby is a very supportive understanding wife who steadfastly stays by his side and follows him into the frontier as he assumes leadership of the seventh regiment of the cavalry custer becomes a man of honor who strives to keep peace with the native americans to prove his intentions he enters into a treaty with crazy horse the leader of the sioux when that treaty is jeopardized by a conspiracy to spread a false rumor of gold being found in the black hills custer sacrifices his own life as well as the lives of the men under his command to prevent the slaughter of thousands of innocent settlers errol flynn dominates each scene in which he appears he successfully portrays custer as being flamboyant arrogant romantic and funny depending on the mood of the scene olivia de havilland's depiction of libby bacon custer as the love of his life lets us see his tender more gentle side the chemistry between dehavilland and flynn who had acted together in several other movies is so smooth and it almost makes the viewer feel like they are playing themselves and not the parts of custer and his wife the other actors portrayals of their characters truly enhance the performances of flynn and de havilland anthony quinn as crazy horse sidney greenstreet as general winfield scott arthur kennedy as edward sharp are among the other actors whose roles have made this movie entertaining the reviewer would rate this a 4 star movie while it is not historically accurate it is very entertaining the movie has a little bit of everything it has adventure comedy and romance so it appeals to a large variety of audiences the casting of the characters is excellent and the actors give believable performances which makes you forget it is largely based on fiction instead of fact the reviewer especially likes that the native americans were not shown to be the bad guys but just showed them as wanting to protect their sacred land	positive
or type on a computer keyboard they'd probably give this eponymous film a rating of 10 after all no elephants are shown being killed during the movie it is not even implied that any are hurt to the contrary the master of elephant walk john wiley peter finch complains that he cannot shoot any of the pachyderms no matter how menacing without a permit from the government and his tone suggests such permits are not within the realm of probability furthermore the elements conspire in the form of an unusual drought and a human cholera epidemic to leave the wiley plantation house vulnerable to total destruction by the elephant people as the natives dub them to close the story if you happen to see the current release earth you'll detect the elephant people are faring less well today	positive
sick of the current cinema output particularly american cinema i've been making an effort to see the oscar winning foreign films that's when i came across this gem slow to start it picks up nicely once war is declared basically an old fashioned girl waits for boy to return from war story the performances the cinematography make this so very much more why tatyana samojlova as the young woman didn't become an international star after this is beyond me though she has remained successful in her own country you take the journey with her young defiant impetuous young girl who through the ravages of war becomes a very sober somber woman who keeps a glimmer of hope her final scene is devastating we love her as much as the camera does and the camera work was this the pioneer in hand held camera work it truly adds an immediacy to the story and the beauty of it like when tatyana's character is running up stairs and next to a slatted fence i am humbled and grateful to see this film	positive

this early john wayne lone star western has a bit more going for it than the run of the mill oaters wayne had been making for lone star up until that time for one it has his old friend paul fix in it fix being a much better actor then the standard lone star villain brings a much needed professionalism to the surroundings instead of the usual hesitant line readings often delivered in these oaters the plot about mistaken identity payroll robbery and murder is as trite and perfunctory as you'd expect it to be in a 1930s low budget western but wayne's strapping good looks easygoing charm and way with a line go a long way to making this more enjoyable plump balding eddy chandler isn't quite believable as wayne's womanizing partner and there's a running gag about something that happens whenever chandler and wayne are about to get into a fistfight that grows tiresome on the other hand wayne's love interest is played by none other than mary kornman the little mary of the early little rascals fame she is a grown up 20 year old now blonde and cute as a button most of wayne's leading ladies in these lone star monogram b's were fairly bland and colorless but mary is perky cute and yes sexy there's a scene in the general store where she works in which wayne asks her to get him a bottle of nerve tonic which happens to be on the top shelf so she has to get a ladder and climb up to the top shelf wayne's ogling her pert little backside as she ascends the steps then again as she comes down then again a few minuter later when he asks her to climb up and get him another bottle is surprisingly racy for a film made in 1935 wayne makes no attempt to hide the fact that he is definitely checking out her butt anyway it's an interesting little b not great but not as choppy and random as many of his lonestar productions of the time the final gunfight isn't handled all that well and chandler gets somewhat irritating after a while but all in all it's worth a look if only to see a cute and sexy mary kornman	negative
brit director chrstopher nolan now has a career in america and a reputation for making movies both popular and critically acclaimed but this small film was where he started and it certainly showcased his talent with its striking black and white cinematography and achronological storytelling that prefigures his later 'momento' albeit in a less extreme way thematically and mechanistically the plot reminded me of david mamet's 'house of games' but the film still feels fresh and sharp right up to the final twist of the ending whose flavour was expected but whose pointedness is unexpectedly delicious the acting on the other hand is not quite in the same class the film has a stylised quality and possibly to a greater extent than the director intended but it's still a fine debut simultaneously claustrophobic and beguiling	positive
all in all big bad john was a hilarious and touching movie if you want romance tragedy and humor this movie's got it if you're a fan of the song like i am you pretty much know how it ends but if you don't or do and want to watch it anyway i strongly recommend this movie jack elam and jimmy dean are a hilarious pair with great chemistry however i wouldn't recommend this movie to strict urban folk you have to understand where these people are supposed to be coming from and only a handful of us are left but even a few urban folk might understand it and appreciate it for what it is a good down home movie that'll make you laugh cry and be inspired	positive
the grudge 2 let's see don't get me wrong i'm not a japanese horror film or horror or grudge basher i loved the first one and the original ju on i feel that much more justice could have been done for this one aubrey only existed to fill in what needed to be 'discovered' in the ending which if you've already seen ju on before this you already know the whole movie all it was really was a complete remake of ju on just more closely followed than the grudge though everyone may have thought that it's coming to america was a bit interesting it was expected as the house burning in the end of the grudge left the 2nd hungering for a new plot save your 6 50 and wait for this to come out on dvd rent it watch it then decide if you want to buy it this movie is good for a fall asleep at 2 in the morning film but overall i'd say a 4 out of 10 sorry grudge fans it's just they just failed at this one	negative
with nurse betty 2000 acclaimed indie film maker neil labute in the company of men your friends neighbors makes his breakthrough into the big budgeted betty's 24 million as opposed to company's measly 25 000 mainstream realm and yet remains true to his roots while his cast is now composed of a list hollywood names renee zellweger morgan freeman and stand up comedian chris rock his material remains just as bizarre and quirky as his first two features proving that he just may be the next big thing nurse betty is one of the darkest comedies to be advertised towards a mainstream audience in years and considering its moderate box office and critical success perhaps moviegoers weren't as dumb and brainwashed as we though they were the story follows both figuratively and literally a naive waitress zellweger who has fallen in love from afar with a handsome soap star as good as it gets's greg kinnear but is trapped in a loveless marriage to a slimy car dealer aaron eckhart who made his big screen debut in company when her husband is gruesomely murdered by two hitmen freeman and rock she's sent into shock and obliviously sets out for hollywood to meet her object of affection unaware that he's only an actor when freeman and rock discover that the car she took contains 10 kilos of cocaine they hit the road as well and outrageousness ensues fans of labute's previous work might have a hard time figuring out how this could possibly be the same guy who directed in the company of men a tragicomedy about two cruel sexist pigs who play a practical joke on a deaf co worker but when you think about it the connection is rather clear in company a vulnerable woman is unaware that she is being ruthlessly taken advantage of in betty a vulnerable housewife is unaware that the man she's chasing thinks her genuine adoration is nothing more than a joke some might begin to wonder if labute is really some sort of misogynist himself considering that his recurring theme involves the downfall of innocent women but personally i think he's coming to the defense of the fair sex and dealing far more harshly with the abusers in his pictures than the abused one of the many charms of this film is that it's absurdity is full fledged most directors when handling a script such as this one would leave the story at two hitmen chasing a woman chasing a dream but labute knows better and has one of the hitmen freeman fall obsessively for betty as well this was an interesting role for freeman to take because it allowed him to play off of his trademark this is the last time' character see unforgiven se7en and 1998's stinker hard rain the supporting cast also includes the likes of famed weirdo crispin glover back to the future allison janney and mad about you's kathleen wilhoite the script written by first timers john c richards and james flamberg is deliriously over the top honestly have you ever seen a comedy or any movie for that matter in which a man is scalped in his own dining room you could argue that the ending is a little too perfect but it's really not worth denying everything that's great about the film for one trivial complaint if nurse betty is any sign of what labute has in store for us next you can bet that i'll be lining up for whatever he decides to follow it up with grade a	positive
at first i thought this film was going to annoy me it was as though i had seen this movie somewhere before the disillusioned hero the father figure and the 9 year old sister who is older and wiser than her years see gregory's girl but then not 15 minutes in it became a laugh out loud comic gem of a movie dylan moran who i thought was just going to bug me was excellent as was mr gambon and the mad scottish hitman lena headey was extremely sexy for half of the film i was trying to remember where i'd seen her before the parole officer she has the most amazing smile but clearly the true hero of this film is mr caine this man should do much more comedy this ranks alongside some of his best comedy roles without a clue dirty rotten scoundrels he is a pleasure to watch in all of his scenes but especially the end no one can quite say f k the way michael can	positive
this film is one of the more risqué black and white films of this time in the early 1930's before the hoyts code was enforced it's the story of a young beautiful woman moving to new york and making her way to the top of the business by using her body as a tool to get there barbara stanwyck plays the young and beautiful lily powers who indeed does a fairly well job with her performance lily moves to new york and makes her way up the business place by sleeping with all the men stanwyck does an outstanding performance as being a strong woman who uses men as one time deals hardly any emotion towards them playing them as if they were pawns lily powers is a woman who doesn't have love on her mind just power and money i thought this movie to be a little bit different then other films i have seen because there is hardly any background music heard i believe it is only because this is when people were first introduced to live sound and dialogue between the people of the film the few times the music is heard is during the beginning as we are shown how she makes her way up the chain the filming and different scenes were something fantastic the director of this film did all the right angles and all the right tricks making this film full of realism this film was all together an alright movie the ending to this movie wasn't as good as it should have been but it didn't entirely ruin it baby face had its slow moving scenes throughout the movie and perhaps a few predictable parts such as who she will sleep with next but this is a lovable movie that can be watched more then once and suggested to some people and friends	positive
my roommate had bought this documentary and invited me to watch it with her she's from china and only heard so much about 9 11 and wanted to know the cold hard truth and she wanted me to tell her more after the documentary i felt awful watching this documentary it was like reliving the nightmare and it still brings tears to my eyes but i'm extremely grateful that i watched this documentary because on the day of september 11th i'm sure we all remember where we were and what we were doing when we heard all of us could only think certain questions why how what's going on oh my god almost all the americans were grateful for the brave firemen and policemen that risked their lives to save others but i don't think we thought about what they were really going though this wasn't actually supposed to be a documentary about 9 11 the cameraman was just filming a typical day on the job and they just happened to be a couple blocks away from the world trade centers and got everything outside and in on tape on sep 11th i thought to myself it's ok the policemen and firemen will get the people out that survived to be honest i thought it was an accident i was in my junior year of high school and getting changed from gym and getting ready to go to my science class someone came into the locker room shouting some building just got bombed in new york we all got dressed quickly and ran to our classrooms as we watched the first tower burning on tv not only 15 seconds later live on tv does the second plane crash into the other world trade center and we knew this was no accident a few minutes later we heard about the pentagon and that there was a plane headed for chicago but was shot down so many thoughts ran through our heads and i kept on thinking what are the firemen and policemen going to do but it's procedure to them i thought they'll know what to do the first tower collapsed we knew it so many lives are now gone the second tower crashed things would never be the same those firemen in this documentary showed courage confusion and strength the real raw human emotions they didn't know what to do they were just as scarred as those other people who were in the towers they heard the bodies collapsing on the ground from people jumping out the windows and here i was in a classroom just crying seeing all that was going on on tv i was amazed with this film and just wanted to go to new york and tell them how grateful all the americans were for their help i know they feel like they were just doing their job but they did more they were hero's every day after sep 11th for 3 weeks they kept on digging knowing that there were no survivors but they kept on hoping and praying may god bless their kind and brave hearts as for my roommate she was crying and admitted this was her first time crying at these attacks she got to see the truth of what had happened that tragic day she asked why i didn't know what to say it breaks my heart that people can be that evil it sounds clique' but it was a normal day for everyone one of the firemen said in the documentary no one expected this to happen not like that those people in the world trade centers or the pentagon or the planes that were hijacked they were just doing their job happen to be there or even just was there for a second passing by they were not just murdered they were slaughtered and those hijackers did it with a song in their heart then seeing in the middle east all the people celebrating why do people do this they celebrated death and the lose of mothers fathers sisters brothers friends grandparents aunts uncles cousins etc why so thanks to those people for making this documentary you truly think about the firemen policemen and the troops in iraq and it keeps your hope up that there are good people in this world thank you to all those people you are our heroes 10 10	positive
the worst ever korean movie the plot is ridiculously complex unbelievable and the film creates not a single shock it builds up suspense well enough then leaves you agitated providing no shock or jumpy moment whenever there is a chilling moment you are not bothered by it as you're still trying to work out who is who and what is going on it goes something like this a modeling company recruit 4 people for a modeling career but the owners are not what they seem they have model dolls of everyone and a strange girl is seen walking about the place and the owners have no recognition of a girl it turns out that everyone is there for a reason and thats as much as i could grasp the ending is a muddle of killings and you don't know who's a doll who's real and who's dead i don't recommend it to fans of korean asian horror films	negative
as a former highland rugby hr player i feel like i can possibly answer some of the questions and confusion that has been put forward i think that i am also in a position to offer some insight into the club and back stories oh and this is gonna be a long post i can tell already first off the people who said that the movie doesn't show real rugby have a valid point the movie is full of bad tackles people in the wrong places and much much more if you want to know what a real rugby game feels like you won't get the best idea from this movie but the thing is anything short of actually sitting down and watching a highlight reel or jumping into a game yourself is not going to be satisfactory it's hollywood not espn really how many sports movies really make you feel like you are in the game not many that i have seen i think it's important to keep in mind that the movie is about rugby players much more than it is about rugby next the haka is very much a part of highland rugby it is not something that they just threw into the movie to be honest i don't know how the tradition got started but highland emulates the all blacks in many ways the uniform is based off of the all blacks as well the movie did not do a good job of explaining the origins of the haka and to be honest i don't think that that is right but i can tell you that every member of the team knows exactly where it comes from and what it means as for the person from china who said that only a maori can perform a haka i would suggest that they take a look at the all blacks and tell me if they think that they are all maori believe it or not utah has a very large polynesian community and a good portion of them like and play rugby for the local teams i myself am part hawaiian whenever possible the haka is led by a maori the team does not do it because they think that they are maori they do it because of some of the issues shown in the movie the concept of unity and those who have gone before is a huge part of the hr culture and the message behind the haka for any of those that are familiar with it support those values it's a chant by a chief who thought he would die ka mate and those around him supporting him telling him he will live ka ora and boosting him up how appropriate it is for a bunch of white boys to do it is not for me to say but that is the ideology behind it and why it is done kia kaha is also a well used team motto even if the actors had a hard time saying it also for the people who questioned highland's rugby playing ability i would just remind you that you were not really watching highland play in this movie many of the extras were former players from highland and other teams but the main characters were all actors believe it or not highland really is pretty good at what they do and pretty well respected in the international community granted some years produce better teams than others it's what you would expect with any sports team but you don't accumulate hr's win record by just being okay the year after i graduated 1998 highland was one of 12 teams to be invited to the world schools rugby championship in zimbabwe the teams were hand picked from around the world and represented the best of high school rugby talent at the time highland obviously didn't win first place new zealand did that but they did manage to take third place in the tournament beating the tongan national champions in their last match and while american rugby may never reach the level of talent that new zealand or south africa has third in the world is also nothing to hang your head about highland also has a tradition of touring new zealand every few years and usually comes back with more wins than losses the majority of characters portrayed in this movie are based off of real people and real stories i watched this movie with my brothers who also played for highland and between the four of us we were fairly certain that we were able to identify almost every main character nobody knew a white rasta of course as this wasn't a documentary hollywood did take some liberties but to tell you the truth not as many as you might think the film was actually pretty accurate in showing the 2 and a half hour daily practices as well as the mandatory personal running and weight training sometimes it really was running until you threw up it also showed the service and other team activities like the chuck a rama buffet that were very much a part of team bonding and finally the movie in my obviously very biased opinion it was a pretty good movie and i think that the reason for it is that i watched it as an inspirational sports movie i didn't think that it would be a pure rugby movie or an academy award winning drama it was just an uplifting movie about a rugby team complete with morals encouragement and a good dose of jokes thrown in for entertainment i hope that i addressed some of the problems that people have had with the movie and hope that you can now enjoy it for what it was kia kaha	positive
a matter of life and death what can you really say that would properly do justice to the genius and beauty of this film powell and pressburger's visual imagination knows no bounds every frame is filled with fantastically bold compositions the switches between the bold colours of the real world to the stark black and white of heaven is ingenious showing us visually just how much more vibrant life is the final court scene is also fantastic as the judge and jury descend the stairway to heaven to hold court over peter david niven 's operation all of the performances are spot on roger livesey being a standout and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful never has there been a more romantic film than this if there has i haven't seen it a matter of life and death is all about the power of love and just how important life is and jack cardiff's cinematography is reason enough to watch the film alone the way he lights kim hunter's face makes her all the more beautiful what a genius he can make a simple things such as a game of table tennis look exciting and the sound design is also impeccable the way the sound mutes at vital points was a decision way ahead of its time this is a true classic that can restore anyone's faith in cinema under appreciated on its initial release and by today's audiences but one of my all time favourites which is why i give this film a 10 10 in a word beautiful	positive
delightful disney film with angela lansbury in fine form as a middle age spinster whose interest turns to witchcraft in world war 11 england lansbury was about age 51 at the time of the film and she is just ideal for the part she is jessica fletcher again but this time it's for the benefit or children and for mother england during a time of great peril the film follows the adventures of miss price lansbury and david tomlinson as the professor of witchcraft in trying to obtain certain information on sorcery those 3 little darlings sent to live with price to escape the london bombings are just wonderful in this enchanting film for all of us regardless of age too bad that tessie o'shea roddy mcdowall and sam jaffe are given so little to do in this endearing film i really thought of the ben stiller film night at the museum at the end of the film when the relics come to life to do battle with the nazi invasion in the small british coastal town	positive
i first saw signs of life on pbs as an american playhouse presentation it's a wonderfully written ensemble production with terrific performances by michael lewis as joey and vincent d'onofrio as his brother daryl arthur kennedy in one of his last roles is also excellent as an aging shipbuilder whose family business is about to close the rest of the cast which includes beau bridges kathy bates and mary louise parker give remarkable clarity and substance to their characters the direction is subtle and effective i've watched this movie several times over the years and would very much recommend it a beautiful piece of filmmaking	positive
this movie exemplifies a certain brand of comedy horror of a strictly adult kind but quite different to the troma movies with which it shares certain qualities the humour is rough and ready but fast and furious if the idea of hideous dolls with evil powers and twisted minds don't make you shrug with boredom reach for the six pack of beer and enjoy the best chucky film yet	positive
an interesting thriller that has paul winfield as a detective on the case of a murder paul winfield was an underrated actor who pulled off all his roles with such ease it was hard to tell the man was even acting maybe most known by younger viewers as the voice narrator of city confidential winfield ends his career with a so so movie but as always winfield shines a treat to watch erika eliniak is well erika eliniak nice to look at but leaves a lot to be desired in the acting department though to be fair this is one of her better efforts bottom line a watchable thriller that shouldn't be missed by any paul winfield fan a decent telefilm to help send paul winfield off to celluloid heaven what an actor he will be missed	positive
spoilers ahead it is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to be such a disappointment i thought this was full of silly clichés and that it basically tried to hard to the american guys out there how many of you spend your time jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkey sounds to the married girls how many of you have suddenly gone from prudes to nymphos overnight but not with your husband to the french would you really ask about someone being à la fac when you know they don't speak french wouldn't you use a more common word like université i lived in france for a while and i sort of do know and understand europe and i love it but my german roommate and i found this pretty insulting overall it looked like a movie funded by the european parliament and it tried too hard basically it had all sorts of differences that it tried to tie together not a bad thing in itself but the result is at best awkward but in fact ridiculous too many clashes that wouldn't really happen then the end of the movie the last 10 minutes ruined all the rest why doesn't xavier talk to the erasmus students he meets back in paris why does he just walk off why does he just run away from his job is that freedom and in the end is the new europe supposed to rest on a bunch of people who smoke up and shag all day is this what it's made up of besides the acting was pretty horrible i can't believe judith godrèche's role and acting why was she made to look like emanuelle béart so much at first i thought xavier was ok but with retrospect i think he was pretty bad and that's all really too bad because technically opening credits scenes when he's asking what papers he needs it was really good except for sound editing around the british siblings and the soundtrack was great too so the form was good but the content pretty horrible	positive
ever since seeing this film as a child over 30 years ago i never tire of watching it from the opening scenes in the horn factory to the car motor running from the back seat of the car to ollie answering the phone and being accidentally pushed out the window by stan i think this was perhaps their best latter day film after this they moved to 20th century fox and while those films weren't terrible they lacked the comic timing of this movie jimmy finnlayson their long time foil in his last appearance with the boys showing up as the doctor is super quote i said goat milk his reply to stan asking him how do you milk a ghost charlie hall and even ben turpin show up i'd say all in all one of my favorite l h comedies	positive
i have no idea how a texan the director douglas mcgrath and the american actress gwyneth paltrow ever pulled this off but seeing this again will remind you what all the fuss about ms paltrow was in the first place i had long since gone off the woman and still feel she is rather dull in her oscar winning shakespeare in love performance but she gets all the beats right here she is nigh on perfect as emma woodhouse she may have won her oscar for shakespeare but she should be remembered for this of course she's surrounded by a great supporting cast including toni collette greta scacchi juliette stevenson et al jeremy northam is very appealing as the love interest even if the script wallows a bit in his declaration of love to paltrow in the process allowing all of the tension to drain out of their relationship several years on ewan's hair is a little easier to take than it was in '96 and personally i find puckish alan cumming a grating presence in anything nowadays but the standout is without a doubt sophie thompson sister of emma thompson daughter of phyllida law as miss bates what this version needs is a scene where emma reconciles with miss bates as she is the character to whose fate we are drawn the film is worth watching again even for her performance alone all in all this has aged wonderfully with charm to spare and more than enough subtlety to sort out the british class system well worth a rental because its unlikely that paltrow will ever be this good again but we'll always have emma	positive
i liked antz but loved a bug's life the animation that was put into this paid off i will definitely be getting this on dvd by the way disney should make a widescreen version of this movie on tape i heard talk of squishing all of the characters into the screen on the standard video format most will have to agree that the ending credits were the funniest i only saw one of the two sets but i can't wat to see the other one	positive
this has by far been one of the most beautiful portraits of a person that i've ever seen on screen andy goldsworthy is a kind of man that is upon extinction he views the earth and nature with such admiration and respect that it's primitive in a good sense his purity honesty and kindness breathes clearly as you watch him work in such simplistic yet full of life momentary pieces of art i was amazed how patiently he created his pieces and how patiently he accepted their end sometimes prematurely but his scottish sense of humor covers his disappointments brilliantly the film is shoot elegantly and contains the same flow that goldsworthy's art has it combines nature and art in a minimal way as it is in itself fred frith's score is organic enough that it blends everything together without interfering with it naturalistic sound this is overall a great piece of work in every aspect it has no boundaries as far as age goes	positive
red rock west is a perfect example of how good a film can be with practically no budget all you need is a smart script good actors and loads of atmosphere rrw delivers all these and more nic cage plays an ex marine injured in lebanon who is down to his last 5 dollars after being refused a job on an oilfield because of his bad knee he roles into red rock and is mistaken by bartender wayne jt walsh not quite as his most menacing but still evil for a hit man from texas he pays him to kill his wife and make it look like burglary only when he gets there just to check her out she offers him double to kill wayne cage just wants to get the hell out of town with his free money and leave the sparring lovers be but a series of mishaps and setbacks results in him yo yoing in and out of red rock back and forth eventually this leads to a run in with lyle from dallas a cheeky and somehow sympathetic dennis hopper the real hit man from texas who offers to help without knowing he's making the plot more complicated rrw never had a big release thus most of it's audience discovered it on video or on cable tv showings viewing it in such a way might make it seem like a tv movie but it's bigger than that the slick slowly timed direction moody score and howling desert wind would have all made for a great movie in theatres but the best you can do these days is watch the dvd on a big hdtv the only weak point of the movie i can think of is lara flynn boyle's boring femme fatale with the nasty dyke ish hairdo i certainly wouldn't fall for her but if you assume that nic cage's character is in to militant lesbians then you'll accept it nonetheless	positive

the most vivid portrait of small town oddity i've seen in a long time and i'm not just talking about australian films this piece of work seems to have been made under the radar and really it's an entirely fascinating piece of work that has a worldliness mostly unseen in recent aust film making at times it is rather slow and strange it seems to meander hither and thither not really sure if it's a thriller or a 'head movie' but the stunning aspect of the film by alex frayne is its iron fisted ruthless direction it never wavers it is highly controlled precise and absolutely self assured the cinematography is some of the most artful beautiful and lyrical i've seen the sound is all psychological the music builds the tension by the third act the story is ramped up and episodes collide and converge don't attempt to piece together the puzzle of the last 20 minutes it's a bit of an impost but by that time the film has you a bit of a trance a sort of hypnosis and you've been sold a riddle that has no real answer	positive
when you pick a movie i hope one factor you will consider are the actors in the movie using their fame to influence the moral fabric of our society in a positive or negative way this is not a political statement this is a moral issue that effects are society when a comedian actor makes curl sexual and racist remarks about a teenager and her father we should ask ourselves do i want to support that behavior in this case mr foxx behavior tears at the social fabric that teaches our youth right from wrong good behavior from bad that loving kindness is better than hatefulness mr foxx should remember he is only entertainment and there is a lot of that out there for us to choose from saying sorry does not get him off the hook it will not undue the hurt or remove the bad behavior he spreads to our youth one way to stop this behavior is to stop being a fan of it no longer see anything they are part of we cannot change them but we can stop the fame we give them	negative

this was a sordid and dreary mess i needed a shower when it was over it goes something like this some socialites are murdered and a woman homicide detective is assigned to the case she discovers that the victims belonged to an underground lesbian society and she befriends an associate of the group who may have relevant information since the detective is an attractive woman of course she is horny and intrigued which reveals much about hollywood and its psychosis about women what's surprising is that none of this is very sexy or interesting just depressing and yucky ellen barkin gives a respectable performance as the lead detective and julian sands provides unintentional laughs as a cross dressing psychiatrist which is why it escapes a one star rating	negative

this is the most ludicrous and laughable thriller i've ever seen oh where to start plot what little there is clayton beresford jr hayden christensen a young billionaire with a bad heart is desperately in need of a transplant clay has been secretly engaged to his mother's pa samantha played by jessica alba on the night that these two secretly get married it just so happens that a heart donor with the same rare blood type is found go and figure the odds of that one once on the operating table clay finds out the anesthesia isn't working and he can feel everything and hear everything fortunately clay seems to be able to filter out the pain of a razor sharp scalpel cutting open his chest by simply concentrating on his memories of samantha which we are told he's doing through an annoying voice over which never seems to stop if you didn't burst out in laughter yet you will surely start to when you see the surgical scenes how could a young billionaire agree to have a heart transplant performed by one surgeon one nurse an attending physician and an drunk anesthesiologist there were more people in the room when my wisdom tooth was getting pulled not to mention the medical behavior which is too preposterous to be taken seriously the operating room isn't even kept sterile people are practically able to just walk in and out of the room without even having washed up during the operation the viewer gets to hear clay's thoughts none of which are too fascinating ah but here's what it's all about the doctors are trying to kill him in order to take his money believing him to be unconscious the villains speak freely gosh what will happen well at least there's no interference from anyone else in the hospital while an incompetent doctor who's got four malpractice lawsuits running against him is performing major heart surgery not even clay's overprotective mother seems to be able to check on his status the only one interested in keeping updated is samantha but oh no could sweet sam be in on it you'll quickly find out through some scooby doo dialog in the end it wouldn't even matter whether or not clay underwent anesthesia awareness because the end would have turned out the same way in both cases if you can ignore the feeling that the director writer is trying to make fun of the patients who fell victim to anesthesia awareness maybe there's some dumb fun to be had enjoy	negative
when watching little man you'll spend its running time trying to figure out its many plot holes and thats not a good sign because this film is supposed to be a comedy your supposed to be laughing at it but will you probably not the main problem with little man is its concept its far too ridiculous to accept even as a cartoonish comedy so when the loud laboured and over the top jokes kick in they make the whole thing seem ten times stupider than it already is but its a comedy some of you might be screaming thats true but thats no excuse for such a dumb plot i mean come on think about it if you saw a baby with a grown mans face wouldn't you be the least bit suspicious and if calvin wanted to hide the diamond so badly why didn't he put it in a nearby shelf instead of a random womans hand bag and how can a qualified doctor not recognise that calvin is a grown man i mean seriously what its not about the plot its about the laughs you might be screaming well heres the thing see there are hardly any laughs in little man and that just make the dumb ass plot stand out all the more if you really want to watch a wayans brothers comedy with a belief suspending plot stick to white chicks because at least that had a few decent laughs what ever you do steer clear of little man	negative
the goofy griswalds win the t v game show pig in a poke grand prize and all fly off together to europe where they manage to cause one stupid disaster after another of all the ridiculous unfunny money spinning sequels this one beats the lot harold ramis' 1983 film was a below average misadventure in which the misfit family went on a nightmarish vacation across the states this time amy heckerling look who's talking helms what turns out to be a disastrous comedy which will annoy you more than it will make you laugh hughes script with rob klane is awful and you wonder why the likes of chevy chase and beverly d'angelo bothered with such a dead beat project as even anthony michael hall and imogene coca had the sense to decline the offer even an omnipotent michael palin is unable to lift proceedings to any level that one could call entertaining yet as inconceivable as it may seem european vacation was successful enough to warrant a second sequel surely it couldn't be as unbearable as this one you know i have yet to see a national lampoon show that was worth the bother monday december 26 1994 t v	negative
even though this movie came out a year before i was born it is definetely one of my favorite comedies it stars redd foxx as a father who tries to understand his son's homosexuality like most parents he doesn't know a thing about what it means to be gay and has all of these stereotypical notions of what gay people are like his son norman is now grown up and living on his own when his father ben finds out that his son is gay he pays his son a visit in hopes of changing him the title comes from one of the funniest lines in the movie when ben gets to norman's apartments he runs into a female prostitute and thinks it's his son in drag norman is that you the movie had me laughing from start to finish redd foxx is great although a lot of the content is stereotypical i didn't find anything offensive about the way the material was handled and it even has a good ending highly recommended	positive
brilliant acting excellent plot wonderful special effects this is what i would say about this movie if i had been watching it with a bag of diarreha on my head for the entire film instead i endured a 2 hour crap o rama our brilliant story begins with some billionare who has nothing better to do than look in volcanoes in a vain attempt to find his lucky charms instead he finds a 5'4 man in a cheesy rubber dinosaur suit and some queer cave folk in his infinite wisdom along with his infinitely large nose he decides to go inside this volcano with a team of special people to travel to this underground land they go by plane no boat no they use this giant soup can with a solid metal drill on the end that i swear i saw wobble in summation this movie was faker than oh that's right this was the fakest movie i've seen for those of you who haven't seen it and are thinking of sitting down on a sunday afternoon with this wonderful movie i warn you if you watch this movie you should be prepared to cut of any shred of your manhood and give yourself a full frontal lobotomy eccchhh the rating system only allows for a minimum of 1 10 i give this a 10 10	negative
peeew this stinks as everyone knows it's based upon some geico insurance commercials what no one knows is why those commercials were amusing on first viewing at best hardly fodder for a series the talking geico gecko that's another story now that would make for an intriguing series and why on earth did abc as reported in the press actually agree to buy the cavemen character rights from geico for this after all the idea of cavemen struggling in the modern world is hardly unique to tv phil hartman had a recurring saturday night live role as the unfrozen caveman lawyer over a decade ago and that's how a concept like this works best as an occasional installment but a regular series fuhgeddaboudit a 1960s series called it's about time also used the cavemen in the modern world concept it lasted one season one of the show's directors who was also responsible for the geico commercials was recently quoted as saying we were so excited when we were shooting our commercials because we felt like we had something that was very unique and we had bigger stories to tell wrong in the annals of bad tv this is destined to take its place alongside 1972's me and the chimp as one of the all time worst the lead actor in the embarrassing chimp fiasco actually went into shame by association hiding after it was abruptly canceled no doubt our cavemen friends will follow suit	negative
i really hate this show i had watched one episode and i knew this show is really terrible the story lines are both poorly written and executed and the jokes are really bad i mean it is just a sh ty rip off of dexter's laboratory and johnny quest 'bout an obnoxious boy with flamed blond hair with his twin genius sisters and talking dog a stay at home dad and a smart super busy mom like oh my flippin' god their dad is a mother f kin' crazy home maker isn't that so gay if my dad is a home maker i would personally die of shame that is really i would i have nothing else to about this this travesty but only 3 word count them 3 words to describe it lame stupid and above all f k up that's all i could say folks it is definitely making my list of worst animated series ev er if i had one that is	negative
in terms of the arts the 1970s were a very turbulent era in literature and the visual arts it was the closing of a great fifty or sixty year period of creativity that has yet to be restarted in music it was a decade that many see as a low point due to corporate rock and disco on television it was a golden age for situation comedies from the odd couple to the mary tyler moore show to m a s h to all in the family but in film it was even a greater period of creativity in all genres that saw the rise of the american auteur directors like robert altman francis ford coppola and martin scorsese from the ashes of the old studio systems that had dominated hollywood for over half a century these directors wanted to craft literate arts films for the masses of the sort that had been staples in europe since the end of the second world war yet the studios were trying to keep pace with socially aware films of the sort not seen since the 1930s but unlike the films of the 1930s starring actors like jimmy cagney and john garfield usually co starring the dead end kids that dealt with social issues in a gritty realistic way or as realistic as one could get on a sound stage the social consciousness of the late 1960s and early 1970s manifested itself most in science fiction films which allowed the left wing of hollywood to preach to the masses under the guise of what most considered little above comic strip entertainment there was precedent for this approach for several of the flying saucer films of the 1950s dealt with the political zeitgeist of the mccarthy era most notably the day the earth stood still and invasion of the body snatchers and the early 1960s saw rod serling constantly subverting the political conservatism of the time by casting social issues into science fiction settings on his classic sci fi television anthology show the twilight zone among the studio offerings of this time were the ecologically sensitive silent running george lucas's first film thx 1138 which dealt with consumerism group think and existentialism and logan's run which hammered away at communism and state control versus the rights of an individual some of the film's references are quite heavyhanded and reek of the then current arab oil crisis and rampant inflation a few jarred strawberries cost 150 and soylent rations its assorted colored foods soylent yellow soylent red and the new soylent green reputedly made from 'the finest undersea growth ' in a manner not unlike the gas rationing of the time scenes of food riots are eerie echoes of the oil riots at many gas stations during the year of the film's release and the scenes of crowding and bodies live and dead lying all about are still chilling as well as influential a later film like escape from new york is an obvious progeny the rest of the script by stanley r greenberg however is rather pedestrian and fairly standard for a dystopian flick but fleischer and cinematographer richard h kline do a great job of filling the screen with interesting images and sounds to spice things up the use of soft dimly lit visuals murkily filtered add a stygian feel to the new york of the film almost like a colorized version of carl theodor dreyer's vampyr the only light in the film comes from artificial sources and were it not for the fashion faux pas the film could truly seem timeless the end of the film where thorn sneaks into the processing plant where human corpses are made into soylent green wafers is both chilling and oddly drama less in the end the soylent minions hunt thorn down but he survives long enough to utter the film's catchphrase to chief hatcher yet one does not know if it is enough for hatcher has already been co opted and has a track record of taking the easy way out yet that fact and its ambiguity shows that the film does not recapitulate its characters' dilemmas and has a depth many later better made films sci fi or not do not have it is also why soylent green is still a film worth watching	positive
as the above suggests i was ultimately unimpressed with this movie it is lovely to look at the scenery is lush but the detail of the story in particular the characters are totally unbelievable films don't have to be believable but films like this with a political edge and social commentary do similarly i have no problem with commercialism as such but once again films like this shouldn't be making casting decisions purely based on box office draw this is absolutely the case with sutherland who is frankly rubbish as doyle his accent was far from authentic but he fell into the biggest trap of all his accent is his performance and we end up with a caricature of irishness with no personality outside of his nationality i find it totally implausible that anyone involved thought he was the best man for the job all in all this is a clear case of commercial interest over quality and when you're trying to be the mission this kind of thing wrecks your chances of success speaking of accents there were a couple more problems one being the striking modernity of boy's accent which acted to dispel the feeling of being transported to another time more surprising was samantha morton's much lauded irish accent which was variable to say the least her voice meandered between strong north and soft south even in the voice overs where i would've expected any such discrepancies to be picked up however these are minor gripes compared to the motivation and actions of sarah she never seems at home with the english and almost instantly at home with her son and his tribe the dilemma between the life she knew and the life she if offered just seems like a no brainer perhaps a lot has been lost in editing perhaps this was meant to be a three hour film or a mini series where these things could've been fleshed out but i can only judge what i've seen now the biggest problem sarah's morton relationship with doyle sutherland is incomprehensible the fact is that her affection for him is not conveyed in any way until her having to choose between him and her son the conflict she goes through at this point was frankly ridiculous and killed the movie for me as you may have guessed this movie didn't work at all for me but it is top notch to look at you really won't see anything more stunning in terms of scenery there are some good performances and my wife liked it	negative
here goes the perfect example of what not to do when you have a great idea that is the problem isn't the concept is fresh and full of potential but the script and the execution of it lacks any real substance it should grab you from the start and then pull a little on your emotions get you interested and invested in the characters this movie doesn't have what it takes to take off and sustain flight and here is why first you don't really care about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to i mean this is not superman or mission impossible here it's suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation they are not believable in the way they act and interact example jeffrey combs as a cop over chewing is gum frowning and looking intense all the time isn't the way to go here i mean what is that he looks like he's on the toilet or something i loved him in re animator and the way he was playing the intense neurotic unappreciated medical genius was right on the money but not for this he tries too hard to over compensate by looking so intense and on edge but in a still mild neurotic manner it's not natural i'm surprised he didn't dislocate his jaw during filming the movie is basically on life support it barely has a pulse and it kept me waiting for something that would never come	negative
'they all laughed' is a superb peter bogdanovich that is finally getting the recognition it deserves and why their are many reasons the fact that it's set in new york which truly sets the tone the fantastic soundtrack the appealing star turns from ben gazzara and the late john ritter who is superb and of course no classic is complete without audrey hepburn the film is a light and breezy romantic comedy that is very much in the vein of screwball comedy from the thirties film is essentially about the odyssey detective agency which is run by gazzara who with his fellow detectives pot smoking and roller skating eccentric blaine novak the films co producer and john ritter basically the gazzara falls for a rich tycoon magnate's wife hepburn and ritter falls for beautiful dorothy stratten who sadly murdered infamously after production 'they all laughed is essential viewing for bogdanovich fans	positive
how they got al pacino to play in this movie is beyond me this movie is absolutely terrible i discovered after reading some of the other reviews that a couple of people actually enjoyed this film which deeply puzzles me because i do not see how anyone in their right mind could possibly enjoy a movie as awful as revolution it's not just that it's a bad movie with a lame plot and overall strangeness that is extremely unpleasant but it seems as if the filmmakers were either mentally retarded which is a very possible explanation as to why this movie sucks like it does though it probably still sucks even compared to other films made by retards or deliberately made every illogical decision to make this movie suck as much as possible for example we see donald sutherland running around with a huge fat ugly mole on his face he does not normally have a mole the mole does not add to his character it is extremely ugly and distracting it's not like robert de niro's mole it's much worse why the hell has he got that mole it's as if the filmmakers just said let's see how could we make this movie even worse than it already is i know let's give mr sutherland a giant ugly ass mole right on his face another example of the filmmakers' stupidity is the character ned we see for the first three quarters of the movie young ned at one point six months later appears on the screen we see ned again and it is of course the same actor playing the boy five minutes later three weeks later appears on the screen and all of a sudden we've got a different actor playing as the now older ned what do they think we're idiots good god again it's like the filmmakers are saying how can we possibly make it any worse i don't think we can oh wait i just had a terrible idea i know a kid doesn't grow much in half a year which is fine but he at least grows more than he does in three weeks just don't get another actor to play ned or at least get him to play the five minutes when he's three weeks younger furthermore the kid who plays the older ned does not look any older than young ned as a matter of fact he just looks completely different much skinnier and no taller or older than the original actor which is very confusing as i like any rational human being thought at first that it was a new and different character what did the first kid die while they were filming the movie because he was in it for the first hour and a half and then all of a sudden three weeks later the guy from lock stock and two smoking barrels is playing ned for the last five minutes of the movie and even if the original actor did die the filmmakers should have at least gotten an actor who looks like him to play the remainder of his role and re shoot the measly five minutes of six months later scenes better yet just scrap the movie completely never finish it and never release never even tell anybody about it because by that point they should have realized that their movie sucks and in finishing it they would only waste more money and time and succeed in making one of the worst movies of all time i'm not saying that this movie is so bad you shouldn't watch it it's so bad that you should watch it just to see how badly it sucks it's terrible terrible	negative
a fascinating slice of life documentary about a husband and wife and their marriage told through the eyes of their son we all like to think that our parents lived happy lives that their marriages were full of fulfilment love and happy memories sadly many of us know this not to be the case of their own families and that of their parents this wonderful little documentary is told through the camera lens and emotional perspective of the son of a family that has just experienced the death of their mother the son being a documentary film maker has filmed his elder family for many years for as he states posterity three months after the death of his mother his father remarries his long time secretary the suddenness of this occurrence stuns the family and pushes the son to dig into the past lives of his mother and father what he reveals is a fascinating look into the lives of two rather ordinary people who like so many of their generation married early for the wrong reasons and found themselves stuck in a family life where they found they just had to make do a wife who found herself at times bitterly lonely and unloved and a husband who buries himself in his work she and intellectual at heart he a much simpler individual who seems to find most of his pleasures in the quiet solitude of work they are obviously wrong for each other this much is clear yet they stick it out for what well that's part of the mystery they clearly show affection for each other at times if not ever much love you won't find any truly shocking disclosures here aside from infidelity on both sides which in good part is what makes this such a gem you really feel that these could be your own parents if circumstances were different and indeed makes one question the lives of ones own parents	positive
though not a huge fan i am a three stooges purist i believe that their best work by far was with curly as the third stooge and their earliest films are generally their best that's because after a while they began remaking their films and the gags started to get stale here in 1934 they were still rather fresh in more ways than one and funny here they boys play very improbably roles respected doctors in a hospital the three run amok acting silly hitting each other and scaring the pants off anyone who expects to get better the non stop energy and freshness make this one a must see for fans by the way although i liked this film i strongly recommend you try to find a much lesser known short from tiny educational pictures nifty nurses is much like men in black but manages to be funnier and is about the best hospital comedy of the era better even than laurel hardy's county hospital	positive
yes they finally got it down to perfection what a great idea a refreshing exploitation epic for generation x whether they know it or not after disasters like sgt kabukiman nypd and getting screwed by blockbuster our hero lloyd kaufman just decided to go for it stop catering to distributors and let troma be all the troma it can be lloyd would make this one the most unapologetic outlandish and downright hilarious troma movie yet this time lloyd takes shakespeare's love story turns it inside out tromatizes it and adds that long lost entertainment value it was always lacking entertainment value such as lemmy kilmister the narrator debbie rochon the cook joe fleishaker the fat guy and of course brutal mutilations and toilet humor tromeo and juliet is the definitive edition of a rather lackluster story and the crown jewel of the troma universe years ago in tromaville n j business partners monty que and cap capulet start a film company called silky films which would produce supposedly tasteful soft core films monty considers cap his friend but cap is out to screw the poor sucker out of his share of the company on paper and in books it appears that monty gave away his life's work for free fast forward to mid 90's manhattan we have two families who are extremely displeased with one another it's to the point that they're just looking for a reason to take a limb or preferably a life monty has a son tromeo nephew benny they with their friend murray martini who's just a little too excited about all the carnage wage war on the incestuous capulets except monty he's too drunk to care like in the original there is a confusing situation leading to tromeo falling for cap's daughter who he has never met or never even knew about unfortunately cap is a sadistic pervert who not unlike tromeo's dad has a thing for the bottle and this would of course lead to daddy's little chenshaw melon being physically and emotionally abused and molested and kept in a plexiglas cage off and on depending on how foul of a mood cap is in cap is also forcing his vegetarian daughter to marry london arbuckle a billionaire butcher who would make just about anyone uneasy with or without the raisin loaf with all these inconveniences the young lovers feel that eloping would be the best decision but how will this effect the big feud it might or might not go a little something like the original but figuring out how this one ends up is just simply not going to happen you'll never see it coming the one with leo is downright sleep inducing compared to tromeo juliet but if watered down over directed big budget hollywood garbage is what you've been programmed to go for then by all means go for it but if you're in the mood for something a little more colorful something that really packs a punch and doesn't follow the normal movie pattern and if you happen to have a rather abnormal sense of humor then you just might not hate this movie tromeo and juliet gives the finger to all that is mainstream full blast exploitation with as much mean spirited humor as anything from a young john waters along with some badass acting tromeo and juliet flaunts a thunderous score which includes the legendary motorhead and not to mention much input from james gunn that really brought this one together for more awesomeness from james gunn check out lollilove and for more excellence from lloyd kaufman check out his next vision terror firmer tromeo and juliet is jaw droppingly priceless exploitation for the 90's brought to us by the one and only king of the b movies thank's lloyd 10 10	positive
just watched it then it is pretty damn awesome the fights are fantastic and the magic is really cool it's totally like a video game in parts with some amazing hand to hand combat in there this film is for the fans to those who loved this world once before and spent time with its friends gather again and devote your time besides this ominous opening the story was not very hard to follow and ihave never played a final fantasy game i think it pays to be familiar with role playing games in general knowledge of the genre kinda helps you grasp some of it better i think though that if you pay attention and accept what the film throws at you it's quite easy to understand there is a lot that isn't explicitly explained and if you demand that it should be then you will probably be confused and irritated watching the film is like being dropped into the middle of some grand saga and having to put as much of the puzzle together as possible i like that approach you get caught up in the mystery and confusion that all the characters are going through but like i said just be accepting if a weird red lion thing that talks turns up and starts kicking ass and taking names and the other characters just say he's an old friend accept it and move on you don't need a biopic flashback or a tell all sit me down you are an observer here of something beyond your experience and undestanding so fantastic graphics and animation great voice acting cool video game styled music involving story and characters and maybe some of the coolest fights you'll see in a while it's worth seeing and while it is for the fans it is perfectly accessible for people like me that have never played the games	positive
hit and run is a shattering story starring the always wonderful margaret colin as a society lady who has it all until she hits a child with her car and leaves the scene hence the title the tragedy is that she goes to call for help and returns but is frightened away by angry passers by who think the hitter abandoned the scene this was made in the days when not everyone had a cell phone or there wouldn't be a story colin's guilt and anguish are palpable and cause her to act so strangely that a detective gets onto her right away her lies sink her deeper and deeper into a self loathing hole causing her to make a bad situation worse this is a very thought provoking story and one can't help but to feel this lady's pain wishing throughout that she would simply come clean as a tv movie thanks to colin and a strong script this is a well above average tv movie	positive

this is a baffling film the beauty in sexual relations between men and women is shown degraded by a set of men and women who can only be described as a collection of oddballs and misfits greenaway acknowledges his inspiration to fellini's film 8 1 2 but whereas fellini is a titan of world cinema greenaway is not he has none of the maestro's lightness of touch nor his ability to convey feelings and emotions with a deftness of clarity he is pretentious the film being divided into chapters with a written introduction to each as if the viewer has to be guided into the film except that the written notices only stay on screen for a few seconds not long enough to be read by the audience with the result that they are mostly ignored as for the women only two can be described as lookers palmira played by polly walker and giaconda played by natacha amal the rest ooze with ordinariness both the women and the men retreat from the harsh light of reality into the dim shades of fantasy greenaway obviously wants to make the point that sexual fantasy does not lead to happiness the women themselves are depressing since they render their services in exchange for money relations between men and women are debased into a commercial transaction there is no sense of joy or happiness or love in the film indeed there are several scenes that are deeply unpleasant the suggestion of an incestuous relationship between father and son philip and storey emmental played respectively by john standing and matthew delamere the callous disregard of both men that giaconda is carrying their child she in fact gets pregnant twice the first foetus being aborted and the second time she is sent away to a destination chosen by the men from a flight book both men having sex with a woman who has no legs the half woman in the title the beastiality that exists between beryl played by amanda plummer with a pig named hortense father and son sharing women between them women enjoying being beaten sexually the father sleeping with the corpse of his dead wife mercifully none of these scenes are shown sexually only hinted at the hinted degradation of women is such that there cannot be any wonder that the film was booed at when it was first premiered at cannes what is more extraordinary is that the actresses in the film lined up to defend it showing yet again that there is no limit to the naivety of women and that women will fool themselves into being exploited by men greenaway's directorial style is pretentious it is a triumph of style over substance a depiction of film as art accompanied by the abandonment of common sense greenaway tries to attain the sublimity of surrealism but only succeeds in showing the banality of human relationships	negative

ah domino is actually a breath of fresh air something new to the cinema world i enjoyed the movie a lot because of the intricate plot the varied characters and the intense camera effects i've seen some complain about the camera work and in fact according to the creators themselves the flashy and wild shots were all the culmination of mistakes made through time all of what you see was the desired effect perhaps some complain because something quite like this has never been done before although that's what sets it apart in a deeper aspect what you are seeing is just how domino sees things through her eyes think about it when it comes to the story i don't see anything quite bad about it despite it's messy nature according to some it is in fact just a rapid form of storytelling the plot really isn't all that hard to follow if you actually focus on what's going on maybe it's just me because i see movies from many different aspects such as the acting the plot etc i'm no interpreter or anything who picks movies apart it just comes to me with that said i believe this is quite an excellent movie indeed despite it's future as a cult classic blockbuster or whatever and the characters well there's no doubting how varied the cast is i believe the cast is excellent as they all do fine jobs portraying their characters effectively that's what makes a movie ladies and gentlemen the characters are all very unique and a plus is that you get to witness a small piece of each one of their lives setting them apart even further basically i personally loved the cast and characters all those who bash and burn this film perhaps just don't see it as i do or it just doesn't appeal to them no matter this is a great film in it's own right no it's a great film period	positive

the elite sniper team that has inserted 24h or so earlier have instead of digging in and making them selves invisible decided to take cover behind a big rock in one of the first scenes when the hero runs to rescue his wife he actually jogs when inside a building and aiming for a target only some 20 30 meter away the hero uses his scope besides the fact that most non elite soldiers would make that shot from the hip and still hit there is also the fact that the scope probably wouldn't be able to focus that close there is a satellite that can actually look horizontally into buildings the list is endless and the film is the biggest heap of crap i have ever put in my dvd player	negative
first at all if you like watching movies i recommend you not to watch this one why afterwards you won't appreciate any other movie so easily anymore actually i don't wanna give rise to any excessive expectations but it is almost frightening how perfect intense and beautiful this work of einar gudmundsson is when in most movies there is at least one aspect spoiling the whole thing like good actors but horrible dialogs or a nice scenery but low budget cinematography in angels of the universe there is nothing of this ambivalence really everything is just great even and not least the soundtrack with the magnificent sigur rós in this story about pall a student that goes schizophrenic after being dumped by his girlfriend especially the dialogs and monologues deserve some attention together with and sometimes in sharp contrast to the plot they range from depressing and fatalistic to the whole opposite of comical and totally absurd what is more they are often with quotes from hegel and shakespeare of such a poetic beauty that the movie almost drifts into a surreal sphere and is only saved to the real world by its incredibly authentic actors one of the other comments was already referring to another point this movie is no trivial entertainment for relaxing in the evening despite of several comical reliefs in between it is largely disturbing partly cynical and bitter and most of all sad it is a modern poetry about a life of insanity with all its emptiness rage and solitude finally when you've seen the movie watch it again there are some great visual metaphors and allusions in it that you realize only when you look twice and connect them with the moral of the story and of course read the book it contains a lot more of the small funny stories in between and also makes you understand some things in the movie a bit better	positive

i'm not bothered by the sleazy hosts nor am i bothered by the cynical self righteous stance the makers of this crap take what i am bothered about is that the vast majority of the episodes are fake i wouldn't even be surprised if all of the episodes were staged hence this isn't a reality show but something far worse even than oprah garbage television with zero comma zero appeal like daily tv soap opera but with more action and fighting and less plot the premise would have turned out great if only it had been executed without cheating the viewer if only this idea were free of all the legal complications trappings that would most certainly ensue due to what would happen with real people and what is eventually aired hence the only way to create this reality show was to get some rather desperate actors and make them improvise and what pitiful and unconvincing improvisation it is most of the time shouldn't this be obvious to anyone who finished grade school most reviews i read here don't even mention that any of this is fake let alone that all of it might be wishful thinking or just boundless naivety the actors hired in this pathetic show are the kind of bottom of the barrel unemployed actors who are miserably waiting on tables waiting eagerly for a call from a talk show or this crap which is when they finally get a chance to make several hundred bucks i even recognized one actress in the role of cheater that i saw years earlier in the jerry springer show and i only saw 6 7 episodes of cheaters how many more of these loser actors are there that appeared in springer and cheaters that i don't even know about however to compare cheaters with springer isn't fair to the latter the springer show is not all fake a bulk of the episodes are unstaged hence often highly entertaining there is no value to be found in cheaters unless you're a struggling actor and want to get tips on how not to act in front of the camera the producers use various very cheap transparent tricks to create the illusion of realness to give their footage that elusive documentary feel but it's all in vein in the end the more intelligent train wreck seeking viewer is left with absolutely squat professional wrestling has more credibility than this	negative

this astonishing waste of production money is filmic proof that the rich and famous can be just as stupid and wasteful as politicians from a silly play by tennessee williams and directed with a dead hand by joseph losey and starring taylor and burton and noel coward this project filmed in a spectacular cliff top mountain island mansion in the mediterranean must have seemed a sure fire winner when presented to universal in 1967 the result is so absurd and tedious that it almost defies belief visually the film is spectacular but that is the force of nature that has allowed the setting and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set the shrill antics of a screeching taylor burton's half asleep wanderings the loony dialog noel coward laughing at himself the ridiculous story and plot devices and the absurd costuming simply irritate the viewer boom is a disgrace a waste of money and talent and clear proof that lauded famous people can be idiots just like the rest of the planet's plebs not even fun just terrible and mad shocking waste	negative

this was a very strong look at prejudice and group mentality the cast is composed of superb actors doing a remarkable job the sets are beautiful and just a bit stylized the art direction is top notch along with great cinematography the story is taut and shows how prejudice and bigotry can flourish easily it is disturbing for its realistic violence and protrayal of a fairly typical community i was very impressed	positive
this apocalyptic zombie film tries to be vicious and shocking but feeding the masses comes off lame as some of the stiff legged zombies stalking the streets in rhode island a zombie epidemic known as the lazarus virus is being played down by the government manipulated newspapers and television stations a couple of brave but dumb souls at channel 5 tv news feels its audience is being given false hope and no idea of the real danger at hand an eager reporter racheal morris and her cameraman william garberina with the aid of a military escort patrick cohen risk life and limb to present a 'live' broadcast to show the doom at hand do yourself a favor and don't watch this thing is obviously very low budget and comes across with the feel of a high school play gone bad acting is atrocious and the flesh hungry zombies are almost comical also appearing are michael propster william decoff and brenda hogan feeding the masses should be left to starve	negative
this is widely viewed in australia as one of the best cop dramas ever produced here and for my money anywhere it's raw gritty the characters are real the situations are believable and it doesn't shy away from the darker side of life confronted every day by cops and the criminals victims lawyers and other people in their various orbits this show ran for 2 seasons and was discontinued because the show didn't sell well overseas we are all sorry for its loss however like fawlty towers we will be able to revere this as a limited length series of uniformly high quality	positive
the movie starts out with a bunch of dead men walking peeps sitting in individual cells waiting for their inevitable meeting with death represented by the electrical chair then our hero who is called tenshu is taken to the chair he's zapped and then he's still alive aha he is given a choice by some creepy military guys who look really cool either we zap you until we've made sure you're actually dead or you can walk through this door and take whatever destiny might lie ahead of you our hero says yes to option 2 and then the actual story commences he wakes up in a different sort of cell very high tech and very big where he finds another cell mate who also managed to survive the electric boogie ride a voice in the speakers tells them that they are free to do whatever they wish as long as it happens within that room sounds a little suspicious but the two men accept what else can they do what these two men do not know is that they have been set together so they can awaken an inner urge to kill within them basically the unknown scientists in the background p s them off until they decide that they should kill each other sounds weird indeed but there's a greater purpose to all of this this is the part which should not be revealed and so it shall remain unrevealed but fear not it is the unknown that lures the viewer to watch more of this pseudo action movie fore it has an entirely different approach to the question how long time can you stand being with a man who's an s o b and would you kill him to obtain freedom the first hour is basically trying to awaken your interest it sneaks up without you actually knowing it then it becomes a roller coaster ride with wild matrix like action fight scenes with a touch of individuality to honor the comic book from which the movie is based upon the movie is indeed very special so special that normal cinemas won't view it under normal circumstances however the story is fascinating the music is fantastic and the actors do their bit some more than others to make the movie truly unique if you should be so fortunate that your cinema or video store has it watch it and enjoy the fact that not everyone is trying to make mainstream movies to earn huge bunches of cash	positive
i just watched this movie on showtime quite by accident actually if i wouldn't have only had 6 hrs of sleep for the past two days then i wouldn't have came home early from work if i hadn't came home early from work i wouldn't have seen this movie i wouldn't have known what i was missing but i would've missed a lot that's the way this movie is it's almost playing on the kevin bacon effect that and causality hence my verbiage above ever character is intertwined in some way or another action reaction interaction non interaction this movie is just wonderful i'm going to have to find a copy to buy	positive
this movie pretty much surprised me i didn't have very high expectations for it but i was wrong mary rhoda was very funny and well written they didn't spend too much time rehashing the past so they weren't relying on the success of the old tv show to carry the movie overall it was very entertaining my girlfriend commented that this could be a weekly sit com and i think i might agree with her	positive
this movie deserved better it's great fun has some wonderful jokes and sight gags some in stuff for the geeks amongst us and we know who we are and the effects are indeed effectual watching paul reubens fart in the face of an academy award winner is worth the price of admission alone i never read the comics series before i saw the movie but have since as good as they are i still recommend mm the film although having the flaming carrot as a character would have been cool too greg kinnear is well amazing as captain amazing and no one else could be the shoveller except william h macy my favorite line in the film we've got a blind date with destiny and it looks like she's ordered the lobster see this film buy this film it's only 5 bucks and some change at your local wal mart you'll thank me really you will oh and ms garafolo is in it that alone makes it watch worthy	positive
this film has an amazing cast mgm took some of its finest character actors and starred them in a film with the usually adorable margaret o'brien lionel barrymore edward arnold and lewis stone star as three greedy old bachelors who live in the same home while they have amassed a fortune over the years they also have been selfish jerks one of them has an idea to donate some property in order to buy themselves a good name sort of like carnegie but it turns out the property they want to give away actually belongs to o'brien and since she's an orphan they volunteer to be her guardians so they can give her property away and look like great philanthropists there also is a goofy subplot involving fairies led by the wonderful character actor henry davenport and since o'brien is irish as evidenced by her outrageous accent she and the little people make up much of the plot frankly i absolutely hated this portion of the film and wished they'd just dropped it entirely instead the story could still have been about sweet margaret melting the mean old men's hearts this would have worked but the little people sheesh overall the actors try very very hard but the silliness of the plot and the deadly earnest way they tried made me cringe i noticed a lot of people liked this film i guess i'm just an old grouch i found the film horrible difficult to watch	negative
let me first off say that i am a believer of ghosts and i do indeed know they exist i have had enough experiences with them to know they are there what i hate is the people who bring the bible and religion into all of this people forget there is more than one bible thousands of religions and beliefs and different ways to interpret what is said in the bible not everyone believes in god and not everyone believes in stereo typical religion religion does not make everything fact one of the things i should mention in the bible that many do not know is that even the most rampant bible thumper is breaking the very rules written within you are supposed to never wear more than one fabric at one time slavery is ok and you may murder your neighbor under certain circumstances none of this oh that was the old testament and now we have the new testament if the bible is the word of god and cannot be changed there should be no changes or versions religion is full of misinterpretations mixed facts and people who so blindly follow it that there is no other way the excuses these said blind followers use are either pathetic or they themselves cannot explain the discrepancies properly and instead use excuses handed down to them from either their pastor or teacher but anyhow onto the review i am a decent fan of ghost hunters and when i heard this show was coming soon i was pretty excited and thought it had some potential as much as i like watching ghost hunters i do not like some of their members and i do not like the way they can dismiss a place as being haunted yet cannot explain anything that is going on just because your investigation equipment does not pick it up does not mean the camera filming the show did not i am glad they are skeptical but it's like they do not understand that just because you did not get anything on your recorder and film does not make the place haunted or not if ghosts were that easy to capture it would be known as a fact not a belief it's more of a right place at the right time kind of thing as well as if there is something there what makes you think it's going to perform for you this show is kind of silly it's usually boring and there is lots of talk lots of psychics yet hardly anything happens the main guy's filtered narration is usually either boring to listen to or is basically not needed also the reliance on psychics is too abundant as i believe very few of them are actually gifted silvia brown is one i definitely believe in but most are sometimes hard to believe i really wanted to like this show but of the few i have seen i have yet to be terribly impressed	negative

i never saw this when i was a kid so this was seen with fresh eyes i had never heard of it and rented it for my 5 year old daughter plus the idea of christopher walken singing and dancing made me curious the special fx are cheesy and the singing and dancing is mediocre but the story is great my daughter was entranced i loved watching walken in this role thinking about what the future held for him very amusing to see him dance and if the songs weren't great at least they weren't disney over produced saccharine sweetness the ogre scene in the beginning was a little scary for her and she was a little nervous when we saw him again at the end but it was mostly benign interestingly we had recently read puss in boots and i had wondered about the implausibility of the story but while staying true to almost every aspect walken's acting made it believable great fun i'd watch it again with my daughter	positive
when i first saw that this movie was going to be playing on tv i only new of pauly shore as this joke of a comedian who wore really weird outfits back in the day i still decided to watch it and i was impressed shore brings a fresh breath of air to the screen in this movie he plays crawl a college adviser that probably needs his own adviser as well carla gugino in an underrated role plays becca a midwestern farm girl with a simple family and a movie cliché boyfriend travis when she heads off to ucla she meets crawl and he quickly turns her into a bubbly blonde californian girl she decides to bring crawl home for the thanksgiving break when travis decides to propose becca needs a distraction crawl then decides to make everyone believe that him and becca are engaged already this leads to crawl spicing up the romance between becca's parents befriending her brother and even getting the dancers at the local bar to get a little loose i'm not going to reveal the end but i liked it anyway don't rent it if you want a poignant performance rent it if you want to laugh your butt of and enjoy an often missed part of 90's humor	positive

a documentary about two rocks bands spanning a number of years brian jonestown massacre and the dandy warhols what makes it special is the examination of the complex contrasting personalities and the ironies of success and failure anton newcombe the main man of brian jonestown massacre is widely recognised as a musical genius not only by his colleagues his friends and rivals the dandy warhols but also by record producers and most people who have worked with him sadly he and his band members are also incapable of integrating with the real world newcombe picks fights with band members on stage or with members of the audience getting arrested at one point for literally kicking in the head of a fan newcombe knows no limits he plays between 40 and 100 different instruments writes and produces all bjm's music can produce enough songs to fill a whole album in a single day has a prophet like obsessiveness with his own musical genius but is also a heavy drugs user flies into rages at the slightest compromise of his own artistic integrity orders his band members about as if they are lower forms of life and can blow deals as fast as he makes them bjm go through a large number of record labels in fast succession they sign them up as soon as they realise newcombe's talents and let them go as soon as they realise he is totally uncontrollable the warhols acknowledge their debt to newcombe's creativity and don't even put themselves in the same exalted sphere of greatness but the warhols have something that bjm don't the ability to integrate their talents with common sense the real world and their market as a mixing pot of talent even if much of it is distilled from guru newcombe and accessibility they are the very definition of 'cool ' dig follows the parallel careers of the two bands with increasing poignancy at one point newcombe pulls stunts designed to generate publicity by sending apparent death threats and hate messages to the warhols in a box containing live ammunition and insults like a bar of soap 'to clean up their act' only he forgets to tell them it's a stunt and they get so paranoid they take out a restraining order against newcombe by the time the dandy warhols take off in europe with hits like 'every day should be a holiday' and 'bohemian like you' newcombe is becoming increasingly isolated bjm are stopped and the band breaks up when they are arrested for possession of marijuana the warhols get busted for drugs around the same time let off with a warning and even allowed to keep the grass the wider appeal of dig is that the lessons of genius versus accessibility go way beyond two bands or even rock music the downside is that it is still a documentary however intimate and it will mostly only appeal to dedicated film fans or people who are already interested in the music of one or both of the featured bands newcombe may well be a largely unrecognised genius and there are feint glimpses of this in the film but to the unattuned ear there is little more than the assertions of the people interviewed to attest to this in the words of one of the band members in every spiritual tradition you burn in hell for pretending to be god and not being able to back it up newcombe isn't pretending but numerically there are maybe still insufficient people to appreciate him in his own lifetime and dig has an uphill struggle to rectify the balance in favour of a tortured but largely unrecognised genius	positive
i'm in iraq right now doing a job that gives plenty of time for watching movies we also have access to plenty of pirated movies this gem came along with 11 other movies and this is easily the worst i've seen in a long time i've seen a few other reviews that claim this movie doesn't take itself too seriously but really i think that's a cover up for the fact that its horrible it's not tongue in cheek the writers really thought they were improving on the movie blade this movie is just one notch above vampire assassin which if you haven't seen i recommend at least that movie is so unbelievably bad that you'll laugh harder than you thought possible this is right at that cusp of no redeeming qualities what so ever from the bad acting to cliché visual ie opening credits to the adobe premier special effects they couldn't even get blanks for the guns which may have to do with where the movie was filmed but if you're going to use effects make them close to accurate as for the cast it seems like they just went to a tae bo class and picked up the first not to ugly chick that walked out once again like ron hall in vampire assassin don't let stunt folk act they can't also the comment about this being a return of old vampire movies no it's not this is exactly what all new vampire movies are about buffy the vampire slayer blade underworld they're all about some super star fighting the vampires this is the newest vampire genre with bad blood fake screams and cheesy over acting obviously anyone who wrote a good review about this is somehow connected to the movie or friends of the cast but what do i care i paid 33 cents for it anyway to wrap this up someone in their first semester of film school decided to make a movie i give them credit because it's better than i could do of course i also know i can't make movies so i don't try i do know how to watch movies though i work 12 hour nights 6 days a week i've seen several thousand in the year i've been out here and this was so bad that half way through i was hoping for a mortar attack	negative
incredible documentary captured all the frenzied chaos and misery which loomed over nyc on that fateful morning of september 11th intense personal and completely riveting 9 11 is perhaps the greatest documentary ever made by accident which kind of gives it an even greater appeal up until that morning filmmakers gideon and jules naudet had been following around a new york firefighter team concentrating specifically on one new recruit in a little piece they were shooting dealing with the rigorous training to become a fireman out with the team that morning filming yet another simple routine cleanup jules lifts his camera up to the sky just in time to record one of the only known images of the first plane hitting the world trade center and from there a simple documentary was no more viewers are given a first hand account of what it was like to be in and around ground zero as the amazing group of fire fighters and one profoundly bewildered cameraman attempt to navigate this disaster without hesitation naudet follows these automatically programmed heroes into the tower while it's entire support crumbles around them the raw fear of an unknown impending doom lurks with more viability then any fictional production could ever fathom as we watch less and less become audible and visible for those trapped inside nearly as memorable is older brother gideon's candid capturing of an entire city in the throngs of a larger and more palpable fear then anything they had collectively witnessed by the time we get to see the second tower collapse as the cameraman shields himself from apocalyptic debris we should all but be rinsing the dirt off ourselves from the amazingly up close footage captured obviously the filmmakers deserve only as much credit as being in the right place at the right time to document such an extraordinary event though one can only admire the two brothers in their extraordinary adaptation to such an event in a few desperate minutes we witness them become like the firemen they document only instead of saving lives they knew they had to save footage even if it cost them their own safety after viewing 9 11 and seeing that it came out in 2002 i feel much more resentment towards oliver stone's recent rendition the big budgeted world trade center many had criticized the film for ignorantly narrowing down the focus to those two survivors trapped in rubble and although i enjoyed the movie just fine for the small and sentimental hollywood focus it brought 9 11 all but renders his film completely obsolete not only will this utterly gripping footage remain the only definitive collection from that day but the sublime transfer of motives midway ensures that this documentary has all the heart and character needed to never sensationalize the event again	positive
probably the finest fantasy film ever made sumptuous colour spectacular sets incredible spot on miklos rosza musical score that is perfect for each scene and mood acting is superb as well in what could have been stiff and pretentious in lesser hands but here the poetic dialog is deftly sensitively spoken the humour is subtle and delightful as well doubtless spielberg and lucas were enthralled by this one along with the four feathers 1939 one of the two finest motion pictures released by alexander korda and london films and one of the finest motion pictures ever made a true compelling classic	positive
they bothered making this movie anyone i didn't think so if you are looking for a coming of age movie go rent summer of '42 this is no summer of '42 when your big stars are nolte sarsgaard sarsgaard gets more screen time that is your first warning sign and of course for such an artsy movie there is plenty of cursing skin flung around just to make it look artsy sarsgaard did his usual uninteresting cardboard character punctuated by moments that were supposed to be intense the intensity is that of someone with bi polar disorder miller is most famous for her looks what she had to say about the city of pittsburgh after this movie pittsburgh should hold a grudge against her she misrepresented an actual pittsburgh native foster gave sarsgaard a run for his money in the cardboard acting style wow was this his first role after high school graduation so we have this weird triangle foster has a crush on miller but is with his boss girlfriend he can't take miller to bed won't take his boss to bed so he hangs with sarsgaard miller watches them get it on then after one of sarsgaard's pseudo intense moments foster miller get it on a scene that we are treated to in every sloppy moaning detail finally just to round it all out foster sarsgaard get it on with foster in the miller role now i know how 2 guys get it on as if that was ever anything i needed to know after all that all that's left is the tragic ending for one character the retrospective views of the remaining 2 it gets me right in the pit of my stomach oh wait that was the pepperoni pizza i just had i'd like back the time this movie took out of my life please	negative
oh god it could be a very interesting film and in fact it is i would have like to give it a 5 but i give a 2 for my vote why i saw it in a theatre see this film on dvd or on tv the shooting is really really poor it keeps shaking all the time in a completely tasteless framing its really painful to see this very interesting film in a cinema you got quickly seasick and you have to make some huge effort not to puke on your neighbor 's seat it's really a shame 'cos the story is edited in a non linear way which is quite rare and a very good idea for a documentary watch this at home	negative
they say david duchovny took six days to write the script for this movie that sounds about right this movie is one of the worst films i've ever seen and i've seen gigli it's not as bad as gigli but that's like saying saddam hussein wasn't as bad as adolf hitler tom warshaw has been living in france with his french wife and 13 year old son he has been pretending to be french all this time he reveals to his wife that he is actually american for some reason this comes as an earth shattering reveal for her despite the fact that she always commented on her husband's american accent also their son remember he was born in france and never knew his father was american speaks perfect american english without a hint of french accent that's just one of several huge plot holes in this movie the main bulk of the movie is a flashback to tommy's youth in new york city during the 1970's as he explains to his wife why he has been hiding in france his best friend as a boy was pappas a retarded adult played terribly by robin williams i assume duchovny thinks that retarded is someone who is just sort of dumb because pappas comes off only mildly slow at times while other times he comes off as just robin williams yes williams actually fits in his tired improv schtick although he is supposed to play a person who is mentally slow tommy's mother played by duchovny's wife tea leoni is a pill popping nurse who is distraught over the recent death of her husband leoni does a good job but she mainly just smokes a lot and yells at tommy for things that don't seem to be too important the script didn't give her much to work with tommy also befriends a lady whom he calls lady who is in prison and offers him advice through her jail window this house of detention is called house of d for short thus the title tommy has no qualms yelling his personal problems out loud on a city street so this incarcerated felon can offer him advice and he does so many times without care i don't want to bore you with the entire summary of the movie but plot holes are abound in this film that tries way too hard to be touching but comes off as well bad real bad real real bad near the end of this train wreck the script gets cornier and cornier and ends with a laughably crappy ending critics tore house of d apart and rightfully so i can't believe some people actually like this movie it is a painful film to sit through and i felt weak afterwards not from emotion but from how terrible it was	negative
it is disappointing to see as talented an actor as amitabh bachchan in such a weak role especially when he was beyond sensational in black which i highly recommend one line in the film states sakar is not a mere man he is a thought and a philosophy director ram gopal varma credits the godfather as an inspiration for this movie and perhaps that is the problem it seems like a badly mangled american movie set in india the left elbow index considers seven elements of film making acting continuity plot character development dialogue artistry and production sets on a scale from a high of 10 to a low of 1 with 5 given as a average score the film continuity seems high an 8 by maintaining a violent tone infused with drama in places and using justice outside the legal system as motivation however there seems to be a lack of emotion connected with the evil of organized crime the acting rates a 4 it appears too weak even when someone is being beaten or murdered it seems hoohum for example when one character is shot in the forehead i found myself wondering if or when he was going to fall he does not and ala ronald reagan he is placed in an automobile with his bleeding face cradled ala john f kennedy the plot rates a 5 as an example of american style gangsterism with a family oriented robinhood at its head character development appears static and the characters seem like chess pieces on an abandoned chess board thereby earning a rank of 3 the dialogue seems stilted and appears to be forced to fit some bowery pattern of speech a 4 for dialogue production sets look to be below average a 4 and artistry is puzzling with far too many close ups too rapid panning and too many group scenes where the actors seem over rehearsed a 3 to me too much camera movement is disruptive the average of the left elbow index is 4 4 and with a slight deduction based on poor derivatism it moves down to a 4 two questions continually arise in the film one why are so many people eating so often and two does not india have its own brand of organized crime do films like this have to be so dependent on western cultural examples as much as i like amitabh bachchan i cannot recommend this film	negative

rumors is a memorable entry in the wartime series of instructional cartoons starring private snafu the films were aimed at servicemen and were directed animated and scored by some of the top talent from warner bros ' termite terrace including friz freleng chuck jones and carl stalling the invaluable mel blanc supplied the voice for snafu and the stories and rhyming narration for many of the films was supplied by theodor geisel i e dr seuss the idea was to convey basic concepts with humor and vivid imagery using the character of snafu as a perfect negative example he was the dope the little twerp who would do everything you're not supposed to do according to chuck jones the scripts had to be approved by pentagon officials but army brass also permitted the animators an unusual amount of freedom concerning language and bawdy jokes certainly more than theatrical censorship of the time would allow all for the greater good of course as the title would indicate this cartoon is an illustration of the damaging power of rumors the setting is an army camp private snafu sits next to another soldier in the latrine something you won't see in any other hollywood films of the era and their casual conversation starts the ball rolling we observe as an offhand remark about a bombing is misinterpreted then exaggerated then turned into an increasingly frightening rumor that sweeps the camp the imagery is indeed vivid the brain of one anxious soldier is depicted as a percolating pot while the fevered speech of another is rendered as steamy hot air i e balloon juice a soldier shoots his mouth off cannon style and before you know it actual baloney is flying in every direction winged baloney at that panicked soldiers tell each other that the brooklyn bridge has been pulverized coney island wiped out enemy troops have landed on the white house lawn and the japanese are in california the visuals become ever more surreal and nightmarish until at last the camp is quarantined for rumor itis and private snafu has been locked up in a padded cell this is a highly effective piece of work the filmmakers dramatized their theme with wit and startling energy and the message is still a valid one in recent years we've seen that catastrophic events real or imagined can breed all kinds of wild rumors that spread more rapidly than ever thanks to communication advances because the technology has improved the private snafus of our time are able to broadcast their own balloon juice via e mail cellphones and blogging consequently rumors is a rare example of a wartime educational film whose essential message doesn't feel at all dated in fact it may be more timely than ever	positive
this film is about a single mother who is happy go lucky to the point that she is almost irresponsible and her sensible teenage daughter who is undergoing adolescent turmoils anywhere but here is an engaging film from beginning to the end both ann and adele are described well right at the start so we get to know how different their personalities are clashes inevitably ensue and they are engagingly presented i find myself so drawn to their state of minds and their circumstances it is as if i am living their lives feeling what they are feeling susan sarandon gives another excellent performance in anywhere but here she is charismatic happy go lucky hedonistic warm and loving all at once i have always liked susan sarandon and i think she is grossly underrated anywhere but here is a captivating emotional journey	positive
from the first scene you are given clues as to what may be going on here it becomes more and more obvious as the story rolls on the acting is excellent throughout and these actors touch your soul even though i knew what was going to happen i was extremely puzzled by the motive i'm still puzzled as to why ben did what he did we could see in his face second thoughts but the ultimate sacrifice seemed to go against his emotion and feelings it was a very interesting and touching story but it left me confused maybe that was the point of the film i did like the film and wil smith can wrack up another good film choice this guy knows how to entertain an audience	positive
how poor is this movie well i got it less than two months ago and can hardly remember what it was about i also paid a 1 for this on dvd the old story of 'put a new cover on the box and some fool will buy it' syndrome all i really recall it that the cast ran around a lot use of cars must have been too above the budget and that a vampire was involved then again guess you could know that from the film's title straight to video rubbish or straight to cheap jack dvd as it is now this stuff will be in the bargain bins at rental shops supermarkets and charity shops until the death of the sun only cockroaches will rule the earth but this trash will still be around god bless the dawn of the dvd age	negative
this movie was good relatively during the first parts of it we have a story from 3 points of view so let's find some clues and complete the story oh wait none of that stuff matters because the fbi guys are the bad guys though that was a great twist it was almost a terrible twist i immediately downgraded the film from a 7 maybe 8 to 3 based on the last 10 15 minutes of it does anyone else not see why the twist is so bad yes it's a good shock but it is bad because it has absolutely nothing to do with the preceding hour and twenty minutes there's no connection to the killers the killers are in about all of 5 minutes of this movie as killers and the two fbi agents are only in 15 minutes of the previous hour and twenty we get it surveillance oh the killers are voyeurs which makes no sense because they were only described in limited terms as just being psychopaths and the hour and twenty minutes of surveillance we are watching of the 3 stories goes out the window as everyone is dead in 5 minutes all of this makes the ending even more ridiculous oh they killed a bunch of fbi agents in the beginning what fbi agents sleep together all in the same room to be found and murdered by amateurs and then impersonated by people who know nothing about being fbi agents a cop 3 feet away apparently can't hit either one with a standard police issue pistol that can shoot several shots i hate movies that try to make you feel like this could be real when they make absurd leaps they think we will believe the other thing is the movie ends about 10 15 minutes after they are revealed as the killers with a girl standing in the field somewhere	negative
tale of two sisters has to be one of the creepiest films i've seen recently in the end there is no actual supernatural element despite what one is led to expect throughout the film the story seems to be about two sisters who upon returning to their father's home after some sort of absence later revealed to have been a stay in a mental institution are forced to deal with not only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bi polar stepmother who lashes out at the younger of the girls when the mood strikes her and cheerfully tells them she's prepared a special dinner at another time but some presence as yet unexplained it is later revealed that the younger sister is dead and exists only in the troubled minds of her older sister who was unable to save her and her step mother who was callous enough to let her die much about the specifics of the strange family is not revealed in the film but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and a nagging hint of confusion definitely not light viewing watch this one when you really want to think about what you've seen it's a hell of a puzzler	positive

i had read up on the film and thought it would be cute a feel good saturday night movie i wasn't expecting anything great figured it would be mostly fluff but hopefully not a totally bad experience i have to admit i was pleasantly surprised the dialogue was pitch perfect most of the actors were exceptionally good and it flowed nicely ash christian was perfect his ability to turn an awkward moment into something touching was nice to see he could have turned this character into something we've all seen before but instead strayed away from stereotypes and focused on the wittiness of the character it was wonderful to see jonathan caouette again i didn't know what he would do after tarnation ashley fink is gem a great young character actress that hopefully will get more work there are moments in the film that could have used some work but all in all not a bad time at the cinema my friend described it as a gay angus napoleon dynamite but it's something more than that it's a character study into what it's like to grow up gay in a small town the pain is there but the humor behind that pain that only age can make clearer is magnified i look forward to seeing more of ash christian ashley fink and jonathan caouette soon	positive
compelling and innovative at the beginning of this criminally underrated whoopi goldberg flick the writers draw a parallel between theodore rex and the 1941 orson welles classic citizen kane the writers are justified in drawing such a seemingly disparate parallel but the viewing public is too often hoodwinked into seeing overly hyped hollywood schlock to appreciate the subtle similarities between these two movies in citizen kane charles foster kane is feared and admired by his colleagues and his underlings much like whoopi goldberg in this movie this movie is about finding love in everybody's differences it is an epic examination of the fear of abandonment and the need for love and acceptance in a society that is dominated by greed and self absorption whoever paired whoopi goldberg and theodore rex formulated a dyad for the ages with the only justifiable comparisons being bogey and bacall hepburn and tracy and hall and oates if you would love to watch an uplifting celluloid philosophical examination of some of humanity's deepest drives bergman esqe but not as depressing theodore rex should be viewed immediately	positive
since starting to read the book this movie is based on i'm having mixed feelings about the filmed result i learned some time ago to see the movie adaptation of a book before i read the book because i found that if i read the book first i was inevitably disappointed in the film this would undoubtedly have been true here whereas in the case of atonement which is probably the best filmed adaptation of a book i've ever seen it would probably not have mattered i'm trying to figure out what the cause is and i suspect that i have to point my finger squarely at michael cunningham much as i respect him for the hours which i have not read but which i saw and was awed by i cannot escape the feeling that he not so much adapted susan minton's book as he did take a few of the characters and the basic premise and write his own movie out of it it's not that i dislike the movie i actually love the movie which is why since i started reading the novel i'm feeling disturbed about the whole thing i feel disloyal to ms minton for enjoying the movie which was so thooughly a departure from her work reading it i can understand why she had such a struggle adapting it unlike what one reviewer of the movie said it's not so much that some novels don't deserve to be a movie it's more like some books just can't make the transition ms minton's novel operates on a level so personal and intimate to her central character so internally that it seems impossible to me to place it in a physical realm even though a lot of the book is memory of real events it is memory and so fragmented and ethereal as to be i feel not filmable i think that ms minton's work is a real work of literature but cannot make the transition to film which in no way detracts from its value i cannot yet report that evening the film does not represent evening the novel in any more than the most superficial way since i'm only halfway through but the original would have to make a tremendous leap to resemble the film that follows at this point i guess i'm writing this because i feel that if you're going to adapt a novel adapt it but don't make it something else that it's not i'm not sure if michael cunningham has done anything wholly original but from what i can see so far the things he has done are all based on someone else's work we would not have the hours if virginia woolf had not written mrs dalloway and we would not have evening in its distressed form if susan minton had not had so much trouble doing what probably should not have been attempted in the first place but it's too much to say that it would be better if ms minton had left well enough alone because evening the film is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its own thus my confusion mixed feelings sense of disloyalty and ultimate conclusion that in this case the novel cannot be the film and vice versa and my eventual gratitude to both writers for doing what they did so that we have both works as they are	positive
i am so angry to the point i normally down make reviews with spoilers but in this case i'll make an exception the first scenes of this movies are weak and then when they get to the meat and potatoes of the movie it sucks this is one movie were i rooted for the bad guys because the captain save the day was unbelievable and there was no connection to him or nothing to make you like him the lead actor gave the weakest performance and laurence fishburne or matt dillon couldn't even save this movie sometime there are eye openers or great moments in a film that may not be that great this movie has none if you are looking for a movie to see in the meantime while nothing peeked your interest don't choose this one save your money	negative
i have a deep liking for this film despite it appearing deliberately less 'polished' than the other fred and ginger films not to mention the slightly problematic casting of harriet hillard in the lead romantic role once again with these films the plot is of a minor consequence astaire plays a rather unlikely sailor who happens to be a brilliant former hoofer of course and rogers an aspiring performer in a seedy dime a dance music hall although their relationship is bright and fun to watch they are bogged down by an un involving main story of hilliard and randolph scott not succeeding in finding any chemistry between them although it was a last minute decision hilliard was rather miscast in this as she doesn't have the screen presence to give this film what it needs despite being sweet and likable throughout the film may have benefited in promoting lucille ball's wise cracking worldy brassy character to a larger role as she simply shined in every small scene and would have made a great helen broderick type side kick to rogers in this kind of bright film see 'stage door' made the following year for an example of wonderful scenes between these two fantastic actresses that scott's one dimensional neanderthal character eventually falls in love with hilliard's is even harder to believe than astaire being in the navy now onto the important part the singing and dancing nothing more can be said about let's face the music and dance other than it is brilliant and moving and perfectly executed and i often finish watching that scene with tears in my eyes however other songs in the film deserve some recognition as well i'm putting all my eggs in one basket is a lovely example of the comedic instincts of astaire and rogers and almost pokes fun at their reputation of bursting into spontaneous perfectly synchronized dancing other highlights are i'd rather lead the band and let yourself go which show how these two talents could perform as brilliantly alone as together i nearly forgot to mention that this is one of the few if not the only time we see astaire brilliantly play on the piano it seems this man's talents were endless overall i actually prefer this to 'top hat' and 'swing time' although only just as it is more earthy and performed so enthusiastically by all involved it is hard to dislike the fun factor	positive
the word impossible has led many to select a particular view concerning any incredible task in 1927 it was believed no man could fly the breath of the atlantic ocean many had tried but failed and some even gave their lives to the effort nevertheless it had to be done as every challenge needs to be met with equal determination such then is the heart of this movie called the spirit of st louis the actor chosen for this historic film is none other than america's own james stewart who convincingly plays charles lindbergh although there are many facets of lindbergh's life the segment featured here is his efforts to be the first man to fly across the atlantic the story is an interesting one and for stewards' fans compelling to say the least seeking enough funds to build a special aircraft to the fateful decision to began the journey on a gloomy day in may 1927 'luck lindy' as he was christened endured enormous risks which are featured in this superb film other notables which helped make this film believable are murray hamilton who plays bud gurney bartlett robinson as ben mahoney arthur space and charles watts as o w schultz the sum total of this now famous movie is that despite poor endorsement on its debut it has since become a classic in it's own right well done	positive
surely no saturday morning tv kids' show was ever done this poorly after all those producers had to count on the audience coming back well in this awful offering they could at least count the money they saved on sets the script could have been a reject from some long forgotten space opera serial with a few smarmy lines added for cool dude gerald mohr to murmur to naura hayden no director could have done anything decent with such a loony storyline so the action just plods boringly along the spaceship props are absurd a bulova wall clock and portable typewriter for example but the planet sets have got to be some of the worst in cinematic history most are crude drawings and it's all bathed in an often misfocused red light even mohr's bare hairy chest is used as a prop and it's a bad one as rib thin as the plot any viewer who can make it to the end of this movie will hear a message from the martians and will probably agree completely	negative
being a fan of saint etienne and the city of london i was very excited to see this movie on the list of the vancouver international film festival this movie has great shots an absolutely excellent soundtrack and interesting insights into a 'not so well known' london the movie is held completely in 'dark' colours which i personally don't like too much furthermore the narration was a little too british and the comments sometimes got a little flat other than that there are some great comments by londoners and excellent shots finisterre doesn't glorify london by showing all the great attractions of the city but rather gives deep insights in what london is really like from the east end to the vibrant centre with its music scene as well as the 'special little retreats' for londoners all in all great soundtrack nice shots great insights narration tiering to watch at times very dark picture worth watching i give it a 7 10	positive
a crackling and magnificent thriller about a child psychiatrist catherine deane jennifer lopez who is desperately urged by two fbi agents peter novak vince vaughn and gordon ramsey jake weber to use her therapy on carl stargher vincent d'ofornio a serial killer who uses strange and horrifying torture tactics is found in a coma by the feds what novak wants in return from deane is whereabouts of stargher's latest victim is and if she's alive once deane gets into stargher's mind which has the appearence and atmosphere that resembles a colorful combination of david lynch's dune or blue velvet and wes craven's a nightmare on elm street the adventure begins deane sees a variety of odd people ranging from carl as a youngster an adorable jake thomas to a freddy krueger like man minus the razor claws i don't want to give away the ending but the movie is great altogether besides the dynamite performances howard shore's creepy musical score and directing by tarsem who shows here that he can direct	positive
if you haven't read tolkien's masterpiece prepare yourself for maybe the best movie experience ever if you have however after having read the books several times over many years i have come to love the characters and story and feel i know it intimately i have my own personal vision of the shire hobbiton and the character gallery thus for me the movie was a disappointment why it dictates the appearance of the characters unavoidably it changes events it removes important storyline it removes not so important storyline great chunks of what makes the lord of the rings what it is is simply ignored even 2001 special effects can't do tolkien's and your own imagination justice peter jackson has made an honest attempt at the impossible and i don't think anyone else could have done it better but the fact remains i regret seeing the movie the next time i read the lord of the rings peter jackson's limited vision will leap forward not my own	negative
i thought i was going to see a ufo movie instead i saw a movie that was trying to make the audience me make the decision to accept christ in my life or risk going to hell the whole ufo thing was one big red herring the acting in it was pretty pathetic in fact it looked as though some people from an evangelic church just got got together and decided they wanted to make a movie all the characters talked as though they were in church conversing with other church members it wasn't real life dialog at all i wish i had read some reviews before seeing this movie so i wouldn't have wasted my money on it if on the other hand you are into the whole church scene in a big way and want to see a demonstration of how to push your views no matter how limiting onto other people then by all means go see it	negative
pretty terrible but not entirely unwatchable another review mentioned predictable and that's almost an understatement you can make a game out of guessing what the next line will be every character is either stereotype or archetypical the good guy in a bad situation the struggle between older and younger priest on acceptance and discipline the repressed sexually emotionally deprived woman returning to the small town after failing in the big city engaged to the hotheaded feeble minded beau from youth the unredeemable bad guys two lost boys looking for a sense of family they're all here and none of them with even the remotest spin of something new from the first few minutes you can figure out exactly what will happen by film's end the story isn't entirely lame but direction acting even from a cast with some talent everything is thrown together without skill as to the storyline we've all seen it before in a movie called sister act this is also one of those films where inattention to small details show up in an even more glaring light as example the nurse and our hero drive into town but park several blocks away from their destinations post office and hardware store yet both walk across empty parking lots for no apparent reason or the passage of morning to night during a scene that seemingly should occur in no more than half an hour the movie is filled with that kind of stuff and then tags on an improbable denouement	negative
this series had potential but i suppose the budget wouldn't allow it to see that potential an interesting setup not dissimilar to lost it falls flat after the 1st episode the whole series 6 episodes could have made a compelling 90 minute film but the makers chose to drag it on and on many of the scenes were unbearably slow and long without moving the action forward the music was very annoying and did not work overall there were few characters we cared about as their characters did not grow during the time frame well one grew a bit the ending was as terrible as the rest of series the only kudos here is to the art dept and set dressers they created an interesting look too bad the writer and director lacked the foresight to do something interesting with that element	negative
how the grinch stole christmas instantly stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from my very first viewing now eight viewings later it still has the same impact on me as it did the first time i saw it screenwriters jeffery price peter s seaman of who framed roger rabbit fame do a fantastic job of adapting the story of the grinch to the screen ron howard's direction brought the story to full life and jim carrey's typically energetic performance as the grinch steals the show some detractors of the film have claimed that it is not true to the spirit or principles of the original story having read the original story i must say i cannot agree the movie makes the very same point about christmas and its true meaning as the original story indeed it enhances the impact of the story by making it more personal by showing us how and why the grinch became what he was mild spoilers they probably wouldn't ruin the movie for you but if you haven't seen it yet and you're one of those who wants to know nothing about a story until you've seen it you should skip the next two paragraphs i think just about everyone can relate to the grinch's terrible experiences in school i think all of us at one time or another were the unpopular one in school who was always picked on i know i was and that's why i personally had so much sympathy for the grinch and what he went through and cindy lou who's naive idealism believing that nobody can be all bad was heart rending when everyone else had turned their backs on the grinch out of fear and ignorance cindy lou was determined to be his friend if only everyone could have such an attitude in fact i think the only thing that might've made the film a little better would have been to further tone down the adult humor and content it was already pretty restrained but any of this adult humor like when the grinch slammed nose first into martha may whovier's cleavage just doesn't fit in a story like this this one's well on its way to being a christmas classic taking a richly deserved place alongside the book and the chuck jones cartoon as a must see of every christmas season	positive
this is the only christopher guest movie that rivals spinal tap and princess bride for sheer entertainment value but somehow never gets near the recognition the plot surrounds the contestants dogs and their owners as they venture into the world of competitive dog ok it's about a dog show the owners truly are characters as one would have to be to be so attached to their dogs that's really all there is to it but that makes it funny enough you'd never be able to convince me that a mock u mentary about dog shows would be funny prior to catching the hilarious scene where levy and o'hara visit larry miller's house on tv but that's really all it takes to convert any doubters spinal tap was non stop hilarity joke after joke whereas best in show was had a few more lulls and by that i mean say 3 minute at most where something riotously funny doesn't happen but the big laughs are even bigger the casting in this one is great and even the typically out of place in uh movies in general parker posey does a fine job in fact her tirade directed at ed begley jr and a pet store owner over a lost dog toy is probably the funniest running gag of the film what's amazing about this movie to me is how the writers somehow managed to weave a plot simple as it was around these great jokes so that it actually felt like it had direction i guess there's a freedom in having such a minimal plot everyone's role is pretty well crafted here and the characters are rarely over the top the realism of how pathetic they seem to the outsider is what makes it funnier than mighty wind or the uneven guffman i actually encounter wierdos like this now and then if you like guest's stuff at all you should definitely own this one	positive
this movie is a riot i cannot remember the last time i had such a great time at the movies i've seen a few good comedies in my time and usually they are pretty funny but this one is wall to wall great lines i think best in show is the last movie that i laughed so hard and so much in the movie was non stop until the end when they did the 5 minutes of sentimental plot clean up other than that it's a constant barrage of one liners and goofy situations i'd like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the zucker movies where you don't get all the jokes the first time around you have to see it two or three times to get it all in as far as the actual film goes it could have used a better edit it's choppy at times but we have to be forgiving for that all the characters are great it's not like an adam sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke i think i will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so likable no victims in this movie also thank god they got a 45 year old actress to play his girlfriend catherine keener plays her and she is a sweetheart in this film you just wish that women like her really existed she's not a 10 like some of the other leading ladies but somehow her smile is warmer than julia roberts overdone overbite if you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it i assure you the trailer does not do it justice they do not give away all the good jokes just some of the mediocre ones oh and one more thing i hope critics put this on their top ten list many of them complain that comedies don't get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they don't put it on their list this means you ebert	positive
the comeback starts off looking promising with a brutal death scene by a mask wearing killer the mask itself is pretty cool too and looks almost identical to the one used in the 1990's slasher film granny from then on the film is mostly boring we get a few more deaths which again are good but there's not enough of them the reason the deaths are so good is because they are frenzied and bloody the story behind the film is actually rather interesting and would have worked very well had it not been so boring for the most part i would avoid this unless you're a die hard collector there's not enough here to even make it an average slasher flick	negative

the only reason i checked this film out was to see the early kim bassinger that and the fact that my tv guide said it was a gripping suspense and it was three star rated the rating must have come from the man who wrote this drivel because the only suspense in this movie was whether i would finish it or not robert culp turns in what has to be the disaster of his career as a cop who is not even close to being believeable at one point everybody is a suspect including a frail old woman if you want to deliberately set out to watch a badly written badly directed badly acted movie then go for it it may make you appreciate fine films by comparison i wish i had that hour and thirty six minutes back	negative
sometimes when a film is panned by the critics one just has to see it to see if it is really as bad as the claim well in this case it was i believe it was meant to be a sex comedy but it was neither sexy nor funny i think i chuckled once when johnny vegas failed to vault a roadside fence and that was it the film follows the lives of four men who deliver potatoes for a living each of them has a problem with their sex lives dave has left his wife and seeks out an old flame who once invited him for a threesome a few years before ferris is living with his mother in law who treats him as a sex object tolly has an obsession for involving strawberry jam in his encounters and jeremy claims to be in a loving relationship but is in fact stalking some poor woman the tone of the jokes varies from tasteless to i don't believe that anybody could write that an example of the the latter being when they tell a small child his father has died in a car crash then for the punch line when the boy asks how his mum is they tell him she is in a coma the blame for this all lands squarely at the feet of the writers the actors obviously made a poor choice agreeing to be in this film but i didn't think their acting was all that bad not that it was all that good either surprisingly for a fairly sleazy film about sex there is no nudity and the sex is never erotic i certainly wouldn't recommend seeing this for any reason other than morbid curiosity although judging from other reviews this seems to be a love it or loathe it film i suspect it would be better watched after a few beers and with your mates	negative
i rented the film i don't think it got a theatrical release here out expecting the worse the previews made the film look awful i was in fact very surprised it was well worth watching it was loosely scripted almost like an ensemble piece of film it had some very funny moments in it and although flawed is an effective satire on the show and the people on the show without being too scathing it is flawed mainly by the awful soundtrack of bludgeoning 'comedy' effects but on the whole it comes across as honest and generally true to form of the show in an altmanesque or larry sanders way at the moment it is the fashion to be critical of jerry springer he is also an easy target springer could have made citizen kane and it would be proclaimed 'the worst film ever made' i recommend this film for anybody interested in the show a flawed but innovative and interesting piece of film	positive
i realize it's a small statistical sampling 8 votes as of this posting but 5 9 out of 10 i'm giving this movie a 3 and even that's generous i've tried to watch this movie three times now the saturday night 9 p m premiere on scifi channel and the saturday night at 1 a m and thursday night re broadcasts and i've fallen asleep all three times before the movie ends which leaves me with a laundry list of unanswered questions for example is lance henriksen that strapped for cash that he has to keep playing supporting roles in these god awful pumpkinhead sequels is henriksen contractually banned from doing any non pumpkinhead movies can't the creators of this franchise do better than a monster that looks like a geriatric emaciated alien who walks like he has a stick jammed up his a when are the hick characters in these movies going to realize that handguns and rifles don't hurt the pumpkinhead why don't they try jamming another stick up this thing's a instead and lastly are the writers of this movie so creatively challenged that they couldn't come up with names for the two feuding families more original than the hatfields and the mccoys while you're at it why not write a screenplay about a fictional president and name him george bush someday i may have the mental stamina to watch this movie all the way through without drifting off to sleep until then if somebody has the answers please let me know	negative
the best movie of the 90's the welsh trainspotting aye right i went into this movie with pretty high expectations and it was all downhill from there this movie was supposed to be this archetypal movie on the drug culture of the early 90's and was going to allow us all to see inside this scene and shatter the media's preconceptions following the moral panic which followed the death of leah betts in 1995 unfortunately it has fallen a long way short where trainspotting was able to treat you like an adult on the subject and potential problems that surround drugs this just provided us with some schmaltzy tale of the wonder of drugs and how it can like you know like totally open your mind cue some guff about bill hicks and howard marks ad nausea it is painfully bad at times i mean the scene at the end between lulu and her auntie actually made me laugh out loud now maybe i am just a cynic but the way jip leads us through this tale is like listening to that acid frazzled guy you once met at a house party who talks to you about how the man is holding us back and how acid has released him from the strains of modern society you just wanna shake some sense into him and ask him to leave the premises the script was a real problem for me because where trainspotting had irvine welsh's excellent book to cite from this is written and directed by justin kerrigan the words jack of all trades master of none come to mind you can see where his inspiration comes from particularly in the style of narration from main character jip which sets the main character in a social situation where he speaks directly to the camera and outlines what is going through his mind as the scenario plays out the problem with this is that some of the speeches to camera are just painful to watch mainly this comes down to a lack of empathy for jip but they are so desperate to sound philosophical that they just end up sounding like your average a level drama project the direction is fine and the intentions are good but it is so lacking in any integrity that you start to wonder what the hype is about saying that though it is not all bad there are moments which are genuinely very amusing and entertaining moff is the highlight of the movie for me for an independent movie it also managed to attract a high numbers of quality british actors actresses which maybe outlines why there was such a buzz about the movie best movie of the 90's not by a long shot but if you're looking for a solid sunday night movie then this might just be your bag inevitably though the movie is flawed by the hype that surrounds it	negative
the dentist starts on the morning of dr alan feinstone corbin bernsen his wife brooke's linda hoffman wedding anniversary on the surface mr mrs feinstone seem to have a nice life a beautiful home in los angeles he has a successful career with responsibility but beneath things are very wrong alan discovers that brooke is having an affair with matt michael stadvec the swimming pool cleaner to add to his humiliation alan then discovers that matt is also having sex with paula roberts lise simms one of his next door neighbours to top it all off he owes the irs who are breathing down his neck a shed load of money alan starts to lose his mind he convinces himself that everything is decayed rotten just like his patient's teeth it's up to him to fix it that morning at work he begins to take his frustrations anger out on his patients first he injures a young boy named jody brian mclaughlin he sexual assault's a patient named april reign christa sauls after he hallucinates that she is his wife deliberately performs an unnecessary painful procedure on another alan also begins to take drugs as he completely loses it goes homicidal starting with his adulterous wife pool cleaner directed by brian yuzna i thought the dentist was a good film tried something a bit different the script by dennis paoli stuart gordon charles finch is more of a psycho thriller than straight slasher which came as a surprise to me as i was expecting the latter it would have been easy to make a teenage slasher film like friday the 13th 1980 with a high body count a wise cracking dentist villain but what the dentist actually turned out to be is very different the dentist is at heart a character study of one mans descent into madness it does a fine job although having said that i'm not sure what he goes through is enough justification for his subsequent murderous actions it moves along at a nice pace has a nice narrative in which i liked the constant connection alan makes between the decay he sees in his patients the decay he sees in the world around him is an entertaining way to pass 90 odd minutes it goes without saying that anyone with a phobia about the dentist probably should give this one a miss or you'll never go again i liked the ending too where the tables are turned i'll say no more director yuzna does his usual fine job here in fact i don't think i've seen a yuzna film that i didn't enjoy to some extent he obviously predictably takes the opportunity to play on our fear of the dentist with some nice dental torture set pieces including pulling people's teeth out sexually molesting them performing operations on drugs torturing people with the dreaded dentist's drill there are some other gore scenes as well a dead dog someone gorily slashed with a knife cut out tongues yuzna gives the film a certain style on what was probably a low budget he likes to tilt his camera which make for some nice angles i liked the shot where the camera is above someone being knifed huge sprays of blood splatter on the floor in a nice wide overhead angle technically the dentist is fine decent cinematography music production values although some of the special make up effects look a little unconvincing the acting is pretty strong from everyone involved with corbin putting in a good crackpot performance the ever cool genre favourite ken foree turns up as detective gibbs one of los angeles finest the dentist didn't turn out like i had expected all the better for it if your a horror fan perhaps want something a bit different then this is well worth checking out i liked it think it's definitely worth a watch	positive

while it certainly wasn't the best movie i've ever seen it was certainly worth the 8 which can't be said for many movies these days this was a pleasant account of a true story although many of the details of the real story were twisted for the movie ie billy sunday's character was three or four people in the real story combined together robert deniro was of course good and cuba gooding jr was also impressive	positive

my brother in law and his wife brought the movie over one night to watch on video this should have given me the first clue that it would be horrible it was from the very first frame to the last this movie is terrible it does not even quite register as a b movie maybe an n or a p one of the worst 5 movies i've ever seen from the rubber raptor on a stick to the still breathing corpses in the car to the beyond horrible closing lines this movie isn't worth watching if you've received it for free skip this one altogether unless you want to play mystery science theatre with your friends it will provide good ammunition	negative
i first saw breaking glass in 1980 and thought that it would be one of the movie classics this film is a great look into the music industry with a great cast of performers this is one film that should be in the collection of everyone and any one that wants to get into the music industry i can't wait for it to be available on dvd	positive
the worst and chock full of people who really ought to know better the cast have six oscars between them it's set in 'contemporary' africa it was made in 1979 and is about the slave trade it's appallingly scripted and acted michael caine peter ustinov and william holden reach a career low in this one and completely lacks excitement never mind any moral focus it's also ludicrously plotted you don't for a minute believe that any of the characters would behave in the way they do under these circumstances richard fleischer directs but you get the impression it was over the telephone this is as bad as it gets	negative

i would not recommend it whatsoever it was like getting stuck in the middle row of a theater so i couldn't leave and watching a part porn movie except they didn't take their clothes off it was the body language and definitely the language i have to say i was embarrassed filming was very low budget no good dialogue yuck actors stunk except the two best characters who got killed off and they were david carradine and dennis hopper it did smack of kill bill and that old movie with the two guys who ride the dessert on their chopppers you know what i mean blablabla the filming was grainy and just a very low quality there was nobody in that theater that liked this movie and the people around me were younger and tattooed	negative
the first review i saw of this on imdb says that vince vaughn is a much better actor than anthony perkins was in this role makes me wonder if he saw the original it's tough to review psycho if you don't have the perspective of how revolutionary the movie was in 1960 you have a heroine who isn't very likable and is killed not far into the movie and a villain who is creepy but makes you feel for him add to that some graphic violence and you have a blue print for some of the slasher films of the 80s and 90s where does this film go wrong let's start with casting anne heche is fine as a vivian crane but as norman bates vince vaughn is all wrong for one thing he looks far too young secondly he has no idea how to play the roll his nervous laugh reminds me of ron howard trying to play a tough guy on happy days everything he does screams i did it the original movie even to those who know everything about it still makes you feel uneasy about the influence of mother on norman and turns her into a real separate character how about the shower scene when i finally saw the 1960 movie on a big screen i was surprised at its power to scare the heck out of me bernard herrman's score becomes incredibly shrill and loud and goes further toward scaring you than danny elfman's synth interpretations during the scene this shower scene merely serves to show us anne heche's naked body and some nice color blood which brings us to the choice to film in color didn't work there is something about remaking classic films that hardly ever seems to work some may see this as a noble experiment but honestly if gus van sant had nothing to add to this film he should have left it alone	negative
very good martial arts film and jet li is the best since the master himself bruce lee li is excellent as the low key librarian cop who saves all time and time again he has a presence and a look that is riveting and believable as the kung fu king that you don't mess with francoise yip is simply beautiful in that mixed race original way that is unique because of her mixed heritage she has an innocence and an allure all at the same time that i found unforgettable the villain the man with the sunglasses and long hair was very good as well but i can't find his name in the credits can some one help me out with that thanks enjoy hak hap or black mask in any language its good entertainment	positive
a famous show master enters the elevator with his girlfriend suddenly she kills him and runs away while an old lady gets a heart attack the name of the female assassin is sawa she is still going to school and works for an vicious criminal akai who is sleeping with her one day sawa finds out he killed her parents even the biggest anime fans will have to admit that this vicious action thriller is an disappointing gore fest kite has style but it is still trash the weird plot about a teenage girl that kills people as an assassin tried to be scary and touching at the same time only causing the story to fall flat on it's face one of the highlights is an action sequence in which the good bad heroine sawa is falling together with a bodyguard from a building yet the dramatic structure isn't nearly as good orchestrated and the director yasoumi umetsu's weird and grotesque animation of the character's faces is awful not only that the intercourse sequences are just simply creepy grade 3 10	negative
we have to remember that the 50's were practically a blank slate when it came to movies hollywood was in transition from patriotic war movies noir two reel oaters etc to movies with a message we had blackboard jungle on the waterfront and so on some folks might think that was an improvement i don't who was the mogul who said if you want to send a message call western union he was right these psychological thrillers are less entertainment than some kind of remote therapy this one is a pip it's about three sisters trying to wrest control of their dead father's estate one of them maybe the only one worth redemption enlists the aid of the company pilot to help her keep the rest of the family at bay he's initially in it for the bucks but eventually falls for her meanwhile the rest of the family schemes to sabotage the romance the results are predictable you get a little bit of everything in this movie sexual tension between the sisters a little subtle masochism hereditary insanity if there is such a thing we never get to meet the parents but they must really have been screwed up the cast is practically unknown one or two of the actors sound vaguely familiar the acting is so bad it's hard to believe it was released under the united artists umbrella by a company called bel air productions it was shot in and around la mostly at night and probably without permits the end was so bizarre that i thought it was a joke it was as if they ran out of money and the producer decided to wrap it up in the middle of a scene i can't explain it not even to myself but i gave this pile of trash an 8 10 i'm familiar with the term it's so bad it's good but i don't think i ever ran into the phenomenon before well maybe hot rods to hell but this one certainly fits you might want to try this if you love movies that seem like they were made in somebody's basement	positive
this is one of the most predictable movies i have ever seen and this supposed to be funny boring boring boring find the fast forward button at your remote and use it i can t say i laughed once and the only good feeling this movie gave me was relief when it ended	negative
upon writing this review i have difficulty trying to think of what to write about nothing much happens in this film the storyline is a south asian woman who falls for an english londoner the problem is he and his friends have had a racist streak at the same time her friend at work is unknowingly to her having sexual relations with her brother and it just escalates from there the problem is that this movie is very predictable as soon as all this stuff has happened it's all pretty much standard it drags slightly even though it's only about 90 minutes long this is more of a chick flick than anything else so if you're male i do not recommend this film to you	negative
at the academy awards ceremony on march 27 1957 dorothy malone won the best supporting actress oscar for her torrid over the top portrayal of a spoiled heiress of a texas oil tycoon in written on the wind the 1956 potboiler adapted from robert wilder's novel was a veritable three ring circus showcasing alcoholism greed impotence and nymphomania malone's performance as marylee hadley a lonely rich girl who picks up men to assuage the pain of rejection from a former childhood sweetheart was representative of the movie as a whole mesmerizing to watch even as it resorts to the lowest common denominator melodrama written on the wind is ultimately the work of one man the incredibly gifted director douglas sirk an émigré from pre world war 2 weimar germany who left his european theater heritage behind to pursue a career in hollywood an extremely erudite man sirk made a name for himself in the 1950's as universal studios' reliable director of lavish soap operas most notably with ross hunter's productions of magnificent obsession all that heaven allows and imitation of life independent producer albert zugsmith offered sirk the opportunity to work outside the limiting constraints of universal's demure entertainments and create a more adult sensational product hence the sultry wind and its follow up 1957's tarnished angels both released under the universal international banner it's anyone's guess why sirk didn't pursue loftier themes but apparently directing these exaggerated dramas appealed more to his artistic sensibilities written on the wind could be considered sirk's epic soap opera indeed it is so rife with human vulnerability and neurosis as depicted among the very rich that it is as compelling to watch as any real life domestic squabble among the rich and famous perhaps more so robert stack not an actor typically known for over emoting nearly matches malone in intensity with his offering of the weak willed brother kyle hadley a mere shadow of his patriarchal father when he finds out that he is unable to impregnate his new bride a beautifully leonine lauren bacall hadley goes off the deep end escalating an already serious drinking problem with a secret gun fetish that threatens to make him a human time bomb both brother and sister as venal and unlikeable as they are are presented as victims of their past giving them a human quality that makes them seem less monstrous and far more interesting than the 'good side of the family mainly bacall and the impossibly handsome rock hudson young hadley's old boyhood friend and business associate a surrogate son to the old man and malone' s unattainable object of desire despite all the domestic co dependency on display it's not so much the story that is memorable here as the way it is filmed with a real panache for pictorial composition and editing director sirk draws his audience into this picture with the most heightened technicolor cinematography imaginable every single shot in this film is an eye filling canvas of saturated colors from the sight of a tank like pink cadillac pulling up to an enormous mansion's front doors to the garish decor of a luxury miami hotel a spectrum of hues almost blinding in their diversity action and dramatic scenes feature sirk's adept use of tilted camera angles shadowy lighting and cross cut editing shown to greatest effect in the scene where a rebellious drunken malone dances uninhibitedly in her upstairs bedroom to the loud blaring of a record player while her stricken father precariously ascends the huge staircase the scene is so riveting that you swear you are experiencing a great oedipal drama unfold what you're really watching is trash of an enormously entertaining kind gussied up in lurid technicolor and polished to perfection by a visual genius	positive
there have been far too few mainstream films set in post colonial africa and the ones that have are a mixed bunch this one with its altruistic pretensions to expose slavery in the 1970s shows the best and worst values of africa which turn out not to be too different to the values of humanity as a whole it also has shortcomings given the undue influence of western pre conceptions of africans and especially arabs dr anansa linderby the beautiful african american wife of the english doctor david linderby is captured by arab slave traders along with a teenage sanufu girl and a young boy the lead slave trader suleiman is every bit the stage arab with his flowery and sometimes humorous rhetoric and gestures to match which would not be out of place on carry on follow that camel but are not up the standard this film deserves peter ustinov of course had more than enough skills to address some of the shortcomings of the script and he rescued what could otherwise have been a woeful one dimensional character continuing the stereotypical theme all three of suleiman's arab employees are unintelligent and one has paedophilic tendencies towards the boy which thankfully are not portrayed on the screen one of david's first ports of call is the local police officer a stereotypical pompous and incompetent african bureaucrat david then meets two stereotypical white ex pats an englishman walker played by rex harrison and an american sandell played by william holden sandell is a mercenary with conventional views on mixed race relationships who initially refuses to help unless david provides payment up front won over by david's love for anansa and conscious of his own inability to find love he agrees to take david up in his helicopter to help search for anansa they find suleiman and his captives crossing the border and are unable to pursue them into the neighbouring territory as a result of sandell's hesitation and david's lack of experience with firearms his helicopter is shot down but david survives we then see david introduced to malik kabir bedi an african who has lost his family to suleiman and is now only driven by vengeance they find the sanufu girl with a group of tuareg and know they are on the right track to find suleiman in one of the most heart rending scenes they kill a party of slave traders only to find that it was not suleiman's group and have no choice but to send their captives to the tuaregs they met earlier later on we discover that the young boy who had been raped is a witch doctor and in an excellent scene with supernatural overtones he uses his knowledge to kill one of suleiman's henchmen anansa on her part and despite the scepticism of the boy manages to engineer the demise of suleiman's two other employees by this time suleiman and his slaves are within days of reaching the slave market suleiman now in no doubt that anansa is trouble attempts to sell her to an obscenely wealthy arab prince omar sharif who is corrupt but intelligent on discovering that anansa is an american working for the u n the prince rather unwisely decides to carry on with the bargaining without considering the consequences the scene where the two men haggle is one of the best in the film at the slave market the young boy is sold to a middle aged german paedophile and we are left to guess whether the boy will still be considered wunderbar when his owner is on the receiving end of his witch doctoring skills david and malik finally confront suleiman and there is a bitter sweet ending from malik's point of view ultimately david and anansa are re united and malik whose life is in ruins can console himself with having seen the task he set himself completed the overall plot of the film is excellent but it loses marks for its stereotypical portrayal of nearly all the leading characters credit must go to all the leading actors for addressing many of the shortcomings of the scripting	positive

be warned neither zeta jones nor mcgregor plays the main part as the poster would have you believe their roles are in fact minor the film stumbles badly between exaggerated comedy and realistic drama with neither being really engaging especially i find it impossible to muster much sympathy for the main protagonist not to mention his screwball friends and sex obsessed fiancé the plot drags terribly and i turned this one off after about 2 3 unusual for me as i like to finish what i start the good acting and beautiful setting takes it from 1 to 2 stars 2 10	negative
having already seen the original jack frost i never thought that jack frost 2 would be as absurd as it is boy was i wrong then again a pix movies have a way of showing unbelievably bad material even worse than you might expect i believe this is the first a pix sequel and it may be an indication of what to expect in the future more a pix sequels it's hard to watch this without laughing especially during the later parts of the movie in which jack frost's offspring which are essentially snowballs with eyes arms a mouth and sharp teeth start killing people with the typical comedic dialogue and silly voices to go with it they are shown both as puppets with a stick underneath to move them and as computer animation which i have to say looks very cheesy the computer animation surprised me as the first jack frost had no such effects i'd strongly recommend that you see the original jack frost before seeing this one both of which it would be preferable to watch with a group of friends to get the full amusement out of it and because it would make more sense sense being a relative term now only if there was uncle sam 2	negative
i loved this movie when it first came out but i was just 12 years old then and i had forgotten this film existed until one day i found a used copy for sale at a gas station i bought it and i couldn't wait to watch this film that had i loved as a kid and then as i saw this film again many years later it hit me why in the world did i like this film as a kid watching it again as an adult i realized that this film is terrible the saddest part about this film is that they had everything in place to make the greatest western ever and they blew it the costumes are perfect good actors there are 2 music scores the orchestrail score is wonderful and keeps with the classic spirit of the old timey lone ranger alive the second score is a series of songs by country music artest like merle haggerd and the statler brothers and those songs like the man in the mask are so bad that they are funny this movies strongest point is that it had a briliant storyline and one of the best western plots ever and for a while its fun to watch as john reid is nursed back to health after he and his fellow rangers are ambushed its fun to see him grow into his new life and identity as the lone ranger as he concels his identity and goes on a revenge run to get the gang responsible for killing his brother and all his fellow rangers to whom he rode with but unfortunatly as good as the storyline is its all ruined by merle haggard narrating everything as you are watching it happen for the love of god why did they do that between merle haggard's narration and the statler brothers singing corny stupid songs like ride little cowboy being playing in the backgound make this movie impossible to take serious i would love to see a really good producer take this same script and story and re do this film right because at the heart of this silly film is a great western i would descibe this film as a beautiful woman dress in the ugliest clothing i give it 4 stars out of 10 if your 12 years old and dont know better then you might love it	negative
after reading so many glowing reports of 'to serve them all my days' i went out and bought it for christmas a waste of money i'm afraid i was looking forward to something in the same league as 'brideshead revisited' and some of the few other great productions from british television but this is decidedly not among them the characters are all too good to be true swathed in a very predictable plot and with the most trite and eye rolling script i've heard in years yes it has its moments but they are very thin on the ground the lead actor is interesting mostly because of his uncanny resemblance to anthony andrews sebastian in 'brideshead' only dark but his undoubted talents are wasted on a character who is insufferably self important and priggish his prickliness is attributed to the effects of his experiences in the somme during ww1 he does the early episodes centered around his nervous condition better than he does playing the the squeaky clean socialist do gooder later on the women are completely unbelievable as in un real his first wife is annoyingly chipper and chirpy the girlfriend the perfect sophisticated slut and the last lady a hodge podge of political bosh the most interesting characters are howarth alan macnaughton and one of the other masters named hobarth i forget the actor's name the high minded preachiness of the script is typical andrew davies screen writer in his early years and becomes tiresome within the first two episodes this mini series is 11 episodes long by episode 4 i just wanted to get through the blasted thing the music is equally tedious limited mostly to one mawkish piano tune and a chorale sung by boys during the credits no expense was spared on the location settings which gives some visual relief to an otherwise excruciating viewing experience i like stories of this sort as a rule and am very disappointed at the maudlin nature of this series if you want to watch something riveting about ww1 and its after effects there are many other far finer vehicles to rent or buy one that comes to mind is 'the unknown soldier' from 1998 the characters in that masterpiece theater presentation are real and fascinating and move one unlike the 2 dimensional puppets in 'to serve them all my days ' as for films on boys' schools stick to 'goodbye mr chips' or 'tom brown's schooldays' i know this goes against the general favorable view of this mini series but i strongly recommend thinking twice before shelling out 80 00 to acorn media for their 4 dvd set 2 discs of which on my set had insurmountable problems with freezing and skipping	negative
it is very rare for a film to appeal to viewers of all ages to children for a fine narrative and a wonderful colorful production and to adults for a literate script fine production values good casting acting all bound together with a fine rozsa score two roughly contemporary films accomplish this thief of baghdad 1940 and the adventures of robin hood 1938 some of the back story on this production is fascinating this production commenced in england in the summer of 1939 moved to hollywood and proved a cover for british intelligence efforts the producer alexander korda was subsequently knighted in 1942 here is a unique case of the intersection of art commerce and politics by all means secure a good cd of this film for your library	positive
this is a comedy version of strangers on a train it works pretty well i am a harsh grader so the 3 rating reflects mostly on the characters and plot the performances are extremely good all of them of course the two stars devito and crystal shine most each performer acts well enough to play off of the comedy works in a level just short of slapstick devito characters work best when depraved his character portrayed as a writing hack would probably be more real if he was published and lauded as much as most hacks are his character would in real life have a great agent and multiple solicitations the characters are one dimensional which is okay in comedy but crystals's character is not written very well his desire to kill the moma all of a sudden makes no sense at all it looks like a pitiful attempt at humor the pitiful attempts are not too often and the movie flows fairly well	negative
given the opposite circumstance of 2009 where the reality is we do have a black president this movie takes on quite a powerful historical significance for entertainment value i found this movie to be both engaging and repugnant i was quite taken back of course by the blatant racism of the time but also found the music and dancing incredible also it is quite cool to see sammy davis jr as such a very young child actor he plays rufus jones a young boy who is being consoled by his mammy he is told 'why some day you could be president' this was so ridiculous in 1933 that it was mocked and thought to be endearing charming and funny the bulk of the movie is a fantasy sequence of what the government would be like if it was run by a black man they depict the seats of government as being like a revivalist baptist church the fact was when i stumbled onto this movie one day it drew me in it is really well done and very entertaining i believe if we can look beyond the racism we can see this movie for all it brings us in fact to realize that it is not only not ridiculous to have a black president but that it is normal just makes this movie that much more relevant it clearly marks a moment in time for our collective consciousness	positive
this movie is not only about feelings and human emotions it is also about everything that could be but it's not poetry in movies can be awfully boring and annoying but this movie is delightful to be watched not to mention the amazing irène jacob a great actress in france one of the best actually when the movie ends you can only feel sorry after all when something is truly great we want more well for another great movie by k kieslowsky with irène jacob we can always watch la double vie de veronique	positive
i've never made one of these before but this movie was literally so bad i had to say something about it i'm all for independent film making as the past year has seen of the worst in my opinion of hollywood's showings the mainstream just seems to have lost touch with what making good films is all about that being said movies like this really give independent film a bad reputation the characters are boring and too stupid to empathize with the direction is horrible the plotting is horrible the plot itself is horrible stay away far away only one brief scene featuring a female's nude breasts and even that wasn't worth a second look the scariest thing about this movie is the idea of ever having to watch it again i gave it a 2 and not a 1 simply because the actors were visible and the sound was audible it earns one point for each of those traits	negative
i think i read this someplace joe johnston director of the film and also one of the guys who founded industrial light and magic for work on the first star wars film and one of his producers or something were racking their brains for a title for the movie rocket boys i guess was lacking something one day they were messing with a pc program that forms words from other words ie you type in a word or series of words and it mixes the letters up and forms other words i think the technical term is an anagram anyway they typed in rocket boys and sure enough what comes back is october sky they were shocked to say the least the title summed up everything in the movie since the movie revolves around sputnik at first homer jr did not like the idea but he warmed up to it after the movie poster paperback novel came out and took off	positive
this movie is stupid there's no getting around it but so is dumb and dumber mind you dumb and dumber is significantly more funny than this however i for one love seeing stupid movies tail sting and laughing with a group of good friends over how bad it is call me callous but see this movie and you'll find that the only way you can laugh at it is if you laugh at it instead of with it	negative
and i'm serious truly one of the most fantastic films i have ever had the pleasure of watching what's so wonderful is that very rarely does a good book turn into a movie that is not only good but if possible better than the novel it was based on perhaps in the case of lord of the rings and trainspotting but it is a rare occurrence indeed but i think that the fact that louis sachar was involved from the beginning helped masses so that the film sticks close to the story but takes it even further this film has many elements that make it what it is 1 a unique original story with a good mix of fun and humour but a mature edge 2 brilliant actors adults and kids alike these actors know how to bring the story to life and deliver their lines with enthusiasm and style without going overboard as sometimes happen with kids movies 3 breathtaking scenery and it doesn't matter if it's real or cgi the setting in itself is a masterpiece i especially love the image of the holes from a birds eye view 4 a talented director who breathes life into the book and turns it into technicolour genius the transitions in time work well and capture the steady climax from the book leading up to the twists throughout the film 5 louis sachar the guy who had me reading a book nonstop from start to finish so that i couldn't put it down he makes sure that the script sticks to the book with new bits added in to make it even better 6 and speaking of the script the one liners in this are smart funny and unpatronising but there are also parts to make you smile make you cry and tug at your heartstrings to make you love this story all the more 7 beautiful soundtrack there's not a song in this film that i haven't fallen for and that's something considering i'm supposed to be a punk rocker the songs link to the story well and add extra jazz to the overall style of the film if you're going to buy the film i recommend you buy the soundtrack too especially for if only which centres around the story and contains the chorus from the book i do not work for the people who made holes by the way i'm just a fan plugging my favourite film and giving it the review it deserves if you haven't seen it do it now this very instant go	positive
it was the night he came home warned the posters for john carpenter's career making horror classic set in a small american town halloween centerers around serial killer michael myers' attempts to track down his sister laurie strode and in the process eliminates all her friends in rather brutal ways leaving poor laurie to fight against the seemingly indestructible michael this plot out line inspired countless horror knock offs throughout the 80s 90s and continues to do so today as well as a poorly received 2007 remake the difference between them and this is quite simply that halloween is the best made on a very modest tight budget halloween changed the face of horror in 1978 and spawned the sub genre of sexually promiscuous teens getting stalked by a knife axe chainsaw wielding psycho	positive
apparently most viewer knows nothing about the history of europe including germany hungary and the whole central and eastern europe as well as the hitler and stalin era nuremberg and a lot of forgotten trials all over europe was a revenge and injustice of the winners what do you think why were not any american british french or soviet defendants after the wwii there were no american british etc war crimes there were no hiroshima no nagasaki no tokyo no dresden no hamburg no berlin no katyn and so on the germans had war crimes too but in nuremberg the justice was not a real consideration the main point was vae victis germany must perish that was also a book title in america 1941 this film is an awful ignoble american brainwashing instrument full of error lie propaganda prejudice and injustice and first of all full of hypocrisy but not surprisingly why wasn't enough the nuremberg process itself this film is a nightmare total darkness after 60 years this darkness and hate and narcissism and lack of self criticism is the real cause of the massacres in korea vietnam cambodia serbia iraq and so forth and there are no american war criminals bravo america very clever even stalin would become envious of it	negative

so im not a big fan of boll's work but then again not many are i enjoyed his movie postal maybe im the only one boll apparently bought the rights to use far cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished people who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned that this is not far cry this is something mr boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks feeling loneley on the set mr boll invites three of his countrymen to play with these players go by the names of til schweiger udo kier and ralf moeller three names that actually have made them selfs pretty big in the movie biz so the tale goes like this jack carver played by til schweiger yes carver is german all hail the bratwurst eating dudes however i find that tils acting in this movie is pretty badass people have complained about how he's not really staying true to the whole carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we don't really know what he looked like when he was kicking a however the storyline in this film is beyond demented we see the evil mad scientist dr krieger played by udo kier making genetically mutated soldiers or gms as they are called performing his top secret research on an island that reminds me of spoiler vancouver for some reason thats right no palm trees here instead we got some nice rich lumberjack woods we haven't even gone far before i started to cry mehehe i cannot go on any more if you wanna stay true to bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true boll experience meaning most of it will suck there are some things worth mentioning that would imply that boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes until the whole cromed albino gms squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh the movie far cry reeks of scheisse that's poop for you simpletons from a fa r if you wanna take a wiff go ahead btw carver gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you wanna shoot him the first three minutes he's on screen	negative
yes talk about bad sequels rick moranis stars in this awful third sequel to the once funny and entertaining honey i shrunk the kids the concept basically plays the same way as the first film but with the adults instead of the kids being shrunk and the inner house instead of the garden as the universe to explore if you think this sounds interesting think again the movie is boring at best right down an embarrassment at worst first of all the continuity of the series has been completely flushed down the toilet the only remaining actor of the first movie is apparently rick moranis the actress playing his wife has changed the actors playing the kids have changed the ones playing the neighbors have changed you name it they try to make us believe this is the same family but the results are puzzling to say the least second the story is a rehash of the first one with not one bit of originality all the few jokes and there's barely any and the dangerous situations presented in the movie are just copied straight from honey i shrunk the kids third problem the special effects i'm sure this has been done on a smaller budget but they are pathetic way way worse than the ones appearing in the rest of the series you're supposed to admire in awe these tiny figures exploring the huge domestic area but you'll probably end up cringing most of the time fourth problem to locate the action inside the house is just boring only few things happen and when they happen they are not thrilling at all the first movie was amusing because the kids were dealing with nature the grass and the bugs that live in it in this one the adults which come up as rather boring compared to the kids deal with dust a cockroach and a cockroach trap disgusting i don't know why the idea of releasing such a trite sequel to the already moribund series appealed disney's executives except maybe because they needed to cash in without spending five minutes thinking about something new i'm warning you leave this tasteless cash in garbage where it should stay getting dust on the shop's shelves	negative
the plot of open graves is very simple it's about a board game called mamba where the players die in real life the same way they die in the game laughable death scenes include killings via computer generated crabs and snakes the characters are cardboard and deliberately annoying and there isn't even a tiny bit of suspense i liked eliza dushku in wrong turn but she is completely wasted and unmemorable here the climax with cgi witch coming from the sea is utterly laughable and stupid the only reason to see open graves are some interesting camera angles plus sexy eliza dushku if such movies are the future of horror then i seriously give up give me any 70's or 80's low budget horror flick over this modern piece of crap a generous 3 out of 10	negative
handsome guys with bad haircuts beautiful girls without any clues stupid gangsters who cannot shoot straight from dragon dynasty comes the hong kong gangster drama dragon heat for reasons which will probably forever be completely obscured the production and casting call for this 'criminals on steroids' movie somehow got both maggie q and michael biehn to sign on as villains but they don't get all that much to do in this horrid slug fest they are two of the best contemporary actors around each with their own resume' and list of accomplishments and biehn in particular has had the courage to take some rather challenging and non heroic roles maggie q was the super bad mai in live free or die hard so 'nuff said biehn is of course famous for being the soldier from the future who made the terminator of 1984 such a believable science fiction fantasy romp by crashing up against big arnold who is now the governator of california michael biehn is almost wholly wasted in this terrible train wreck of a police drama there is absolutely no reason for that as the incredibly convoluted plot given mostly in chinese as it is a hong kong story could have been better elaborated for non chinese audiences with a foreign narrator in other words if biehn had been used as something like an interpol observer or coordinator or an agent under deep cover who needs to get some 'splaining given to him every five or ten minutes that would have been great but no he's brought in as a part of an odd group of special forces type bad guys who seem to be freelancing their own corrupt deal in the middle of somebody else's totally corrupt deal involving the local king of corrupt deals yes there i said it all confused me too welcome to the party pal in the truly superb hong kong crime drama known by its english title as breaking news there are also a number of fascinating characters at work but there is only one story line in the plot bad guys vs good cops in this wretched and excessively violent foray into the world of a hong kong triad or gang it seems that the hot shot police force is little more than a parade of ducks in a shooting gallery the way the criminals mow them down so not surprisingly there's an almost otherwise incomprehensible scene several scenes in fact where kids are trying to shoot wooden ducks in an arcade game to win stuffed animal prizes and so the hot shot good guy police officers quite naturally intervene on their behalf so that the arcade owner has to give up the kewpie dolls there's also a half hearted attempt at creating a love interest between one of the 'visiting cops' and the sole female 'visiting cop' the visiting cops are supposed to be material witnesses against the triad gangster leader who gets hijacked on the way to his court appearance but not by his own team but by the mercenaries biehn maggie q and some others these killers all want something but we don't get to learn about what it is until the very end of the film that was a stupid mistake inside of the overall story you cannot build suspense in a crime drama without something to obtain or get or get away from being introduced very early in the story add to that some cut away scenes done for purely artsy effects all showing the bad bad guys' and the regular bad guys' recent pasts and any film buff can readily understand why this barking dog gets a 1 rating from this fan of all things cinematic with criminals and conspirators and hong kong	negative
here's my first david mamet directed film fitting since it was his first as well the story here is uneven and it moves along like any con movie from the little cons to the big cons to the all encompassing con it's like the grifters but without that film's level of acting in that film john cusack was sort of bland but that was the nature of his character the acting here is very flat i sometimes wondered if the bland acting by crouse was supposed to be some sort of attack on psychoanalysis at least in the beginning it never gets really good but it evolves beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes early in the film some of lindsay crouse's lines the way she reads them sound as if they're inner monologue or narration which they aren't with the arrival of mantegna things pick up the dialogue here isn't as fun as it should be i was expecting crackerjack ring a ding ding lines that roll off the tongue but these ones don't it all sounds very read rather than spoken maybe mamet evolved after this film and loosened up but if not then maybe he should let others direct his words he's far too precious with them here and as a result they lose their rhythmic jazzy quality what's more strange is that other than this the film doesn't look or feel like a play the camera is very cinematic my only problem with glengarry glen ross was that it looked too much like filmed theatre but in that film the actors were not only accomplished but relaxed and free everything flowed i wouldn't mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines or even play characters speaking play lines but here it sounds like movie or even book characters speaking play lines it's a weird jumble of theatre and film that just doesn't work that doesn't mean the movie is bad it isn't it's often extremely entertaining the best chunk is in the middle it's standard con movie stuff the new guy in this case girl margaret ford lindsay crouse gets involved in the seedy con underworld how she gets involved is she's a psychiatrist and one of her patients billy is a compulsive gambler she wants to help him out with his gambling debt so she walks into the house of games a dingy game room where con men work in a back room i'll admit the setup is pretty improbable were they just expecting crouse to come in were they expecting she'd write a cheque was billy in on it one of these questions is definitely answered by the end however and from here the cons are start to roll out i found the beginning ones the little learner ones to be the most fun we're getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as crouse is we see the ending coming and then we didn't see the second ending coming and then the real ending i didn't see coming but maybe you did the ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second crouse walked into the house of games she found her true calling i'm going to forgive the annoying opening the improbable bits and the strange line reading because there are many good things here if the first part of the movie seems stagy stick with it after the half hour mark it does really get a momentum going if you want a fun con movie then here she is if you want mamet go watch glengarry glen ross again james foley did him better	positive
one of the worst movies i saw in the 90s i'd often use it as a benchmark when viewing other films at least it wasn't as bad as caro diario three absolutely pointless segments all featuring the director playing himself and he's not that interesting a whole segment about this hypochondriac going to the doctor another that features him riding around the countryside on his scooter for three interesting minutes and another fifteen torturous ones the only redeeming factor was that the scooter scene was set to keith jarrett's 'koln concert' prompted me to go home and rediscover that marvelous album the best thing you can say about the director actor egotist is that he's got great taste in music	negative
a very close and sharp discription of the bubbling and dynamic emotional world of specialy one 18year old guy that makes his first experiences in his gay love to an other boy during an vacation with a part of his family i liked this film because of his extremly clear and surrogated storytelling with all this sound close ups and quiet moments wich had been full of intensive moods	positive
i was looking on imdbs bottom 100 because i thought id never seen anything as bad as plan 9 from outerspace or roller ball remake i was wrong ben and arthur has beaten both this out of the many countless amount of movies i've seen is the number one worst film on the i ever saw bad directing bad characters horrible acting horrible story there's a reason nobody but sam ever says anything positive about this film sam was a horrible annoying actor but his directing was so bad he may just overthrow ed wood the director should be ashamed of his work unfortunately i have to give it at least 1 star but it deserves to be continued stars	negative
i remember watching this movie on tv a few years back it was so bad i can only remember the scenes that just made me die laughing the only plot summary i can give you without any spoilers is picture a home movie made by college kids who were high spoiler alert starts here when the movie starts a guy's running being chased by the demon cop when in fact the man was really being chased by a halloween costume gone wrong a car pops out of nowhere hitting the guy who was running it sends him flying over the top of it and what does the driver do watches the man as he falls gets back in his car and drives away what kind of hair brained dolt would do that i would've at least asked if the guy was okay then some black guy stares the demon cop straight in the face then later tells reporters i didn't get a good look at him my sisters and i by then were almost choking ourselves to death with laughter then there's some scene in an alley where this girl with an afro pulls a machine gun out of her teeny weeny little purse it couldn't have possibly fit i can hardly remember certain scenes maybe it's because they were just that bad cops in the film can't even jump a fence and the acting is so wooden it makes planks of wood look like better actors all in all this movie brings shame to hollywood way more than any other flop could you have to see it to believe its sappy cheesy plot which it has none of as far as i can tell	negative
may contain spoilers sadly lou costellos' last film has the distinction of being slightly better than abbott costello's last movie together dance with me henry this movie isn't all in all outright terrible it is an amusing career misfire dorothy provine is nice to look at and makes the movie somewhat bearable you can't blame lou costello for this because a major studio released it which meant somebody had to give it the green light in my opinion lou costello was getting over problems of his own losing his son a few years earlier and the unwarranted attacks from the irs if you look at the last 3 4 abbott costello movies you can notice the magic was gone check out dance with me henry now that's a painful movie to watch	negative
here's the kind of love story that i do enjoy watching and mostly it's for two reasons one it concentrates of young people very young people people who are still in their teens and are experiencing love for the first time or at least think they are all of us have been there in our lives and the man in the moon is a magnificent reflection upon our memories maybe adding on a few more details and enhancing it further than any of us have experienced the second reason is that is a love triangle and i do believe that as teens it's the most dramatic and the story is so well developed that you believe the characters could really be in love or are just so new to love that they just strongly believe they are and after a tragedy or so occurs will believe it for the rest of their lives the cast of the man in the moon is full of great talented names it stars sam waterston who is truly a versatile actor well capable of playing tough district attorneys as well as strict yet caring and wise fathers as in this film also there is tess harper jason london and a young young reese witherspoon you look at the young talented actress as she is at age fourteen and you think that about ten years down the road she's going to win the academy award all members of the cast pull off great performances and with the dialogue of the compelling screenplay they are enhanced into looking like real people in real situations as if it all really happened this the kind of movie that i would like to see come out more often love story or not i would love to see films that make everything look real and is not phony or disbelievable in any way	positive
based on the true story about christopher boyce hutton and daulton lee penn and their involvement in selling american secret government documents to the soviets during the 1970s boyce works for the government and his job is to guard these particular documents which ultimately disillusions him about his country's affairs and practices he then enlists his drug dealer friend daulton lee who has become a wanted man to be the courier for these sensitive documents lee infiltrates the russian embassy in mexico and makes contact with alex suchet and they both begin to play the espionage game lee's interest is purely about money whilst boyce is acting out of anger towards the system he is involved in alex believes lee to be the inside man in the american government things start to become array when lee's drug addiction and reckless behaviour in handling the courier position offsets both alex and boyce lee becomes more paranoid and the initial espionage game becomes more deadly and consequential for everyone involved this is a true spy thriller without the cheesy action the character motives and analysis of real life subjects is sympathetic but very well written and the film cleverly interweaves the real life events with underlying political themes about human predatory behaviour where a bigger nation uses their political power to control the smaller nations well directed and intense in parts especially where the protagonists become immensely in over their heads in the spy game timothy hutton and sean penn give amazingly riveting performances in a film that questions authority and yet there is no simple answer to the political message or the complexity of that system the plight of the protagonists becomes the underlying message within 'the falcon and the snowman' and makes it a clever political thriller with a poignant element about society human relationships and the american system great film 1 2 out of	positive
perhaps the most polished and accomplished of all indian films pakeezah does not fall into any of the traps commonly associated with bollywood film ie tackiness farce wholesale and unsuccessful imitation of western film themes genres pakeezah is indigenous to the sub continent and authentic almost madam butterfly like in plot characters are well developed direction although sometimes unrefined by today's standards perceptive and convincing the urdu speaking milieux at the time of pakeezah were masters of understatement and how the dialogue conveys the subtleties of the age the acting particularly the 'looks' and the dynamic between characters are a delight to behold although the nuances may be lost on contemporary viewers or those not acquainted with the mores and customs of muslim india coupled with a captivating screenplay is a beautiful musical score enhanced by the protagonist displaying eminent command of classical indian dance kathak as is the case with most romantic tragedies the heroine must die but she does not take her leave of the audience without the viewer feeling he she has been party to a truly memorable cinema experience pakeezah is surely the pinnacle of what indian cinema has produced and is unlikely to be paralleled	positive
we're both stumbling around together in this unformed world whose rules and objectives are largely unknown seemingly indecipherable or even possibly nonexistent always on the verge of being killed by forces that we don't understand so says ted pikul in the film which for some people sums up life and 'existenz' probably is a film about existence what is real and what is unreal and how you tell the difference or not the last line of the film is superbly ambiguous the film seems like a shaggy dog story indeed it has a real shaggy dog in it but it takes you along on an interesting ride full of provocative cronenberg touches that will make you look at amphibians game pods fish spines and bones in a new light some bits are quite icky it takes place in a rural setting where the gas station is called 'gas station' and a chinese restaurant is called 'chinese restaurant 'the film has an engrossing texture that is leagues away from your usual big budget science fiction movie you can read many things into the film and it repays watching more than once the main actors are jude law who is ok and jennifer jason leigh who is great some roles don't suit this very talented actor but when she has a good role like this she is unmatchable her unconventional beauty and fascinating voice suits the part of allegra looks great in a short black skirt too there are other familiar actors but they are not given much to do it looks good sounds good and a howard shore score complements the film very well cronenberg is possibly the alfred hitchcock of the sci fi horror genre no matter what film he makes he is always worth watching	positive
the main reason for watching this picture is to savor the brilliant performance of s ephata merkerson ms merkerson dominates this film with her tremendous presence as nanny the woman who believes in doing good no matter to whom with no strings attached this actress clearly shows a range that is amazing thanks to director george wolf for bringing this distinguished cast of some of the best black americans actors together this ensemble group under his tight direction help create the right atmosphere in which the action takes place of course none of this would have been possible if ruben santiago hudson hadn't written his wonderful play working with mr wolf perhaps the best theater director of this generation they have opened the play in a way that it evokes that not too distant past where a child lives under the influence of ms crosby when his own parents are not around to take care of him ms crosby becomes the adoring mother of little ruben in a way he represents her reward for having lost her own daughter unfortunately there is no time to develop some of the characters as the action solely concentrates in enhancing the relationship between nanny and the young ruben played with such charm by the young marcus carl franklin who is a natural the only thing that could have been done differently was the voice over narration that is at times intrusive as it doesn't clarify or justify what one is seeing frankly just by watching the interaction of the players is self explanatory in the background there is always music no matter what hard times these people are going through but nanny's house is full of laughter and that glorious music that takes us back to that era aside from ms merkerson other notable performances are given by terrence dashon howard one of the rising stars of the moment mos def jeffrey wright marcy gray louis gossett jr delroy lindo rosie perez carmen ejogo jimmy smits and the rest ms s ephata merkerson deserves to be seen by a wider audience in lackawanna blues she clearly demonstrates she can do anything she wants because of her enormous talent and charisma	positive
this movie is supposed to take place in milford nj i know the house that it is based on as well as the person as you see at the end of themovie she was killed in the world trade center incident i know that because i was one of the police officers that helped with the identification of her remains she was the only one in our area lost the nudity in the movie went a bit far i am not a prude but the actors could have filmed the scene with the two woman without actually showing the whole thing this movie is in poor taste and i cannot see how her family would give there blessing to it this is an insult to the person whom it is based on	negative
it's often said that tobe hooper just struck lucky with his grisly 1974 horror film 'the texas chain saw massacre' and every time i see another hooper film that view is only reinforced it would seem that hooper wanted to make his own version of films such as scanners and firestarter in 1990 and so we end up with spontaneous combustion a film with a couple of good ideas and a whole load more that are borrowed from other films put it all together and you get a messy boring film that most people would do well to miss the film leads the audience to believe that it might be half decent initially with an intriguing back story that focuses on some experiments carried out on two young people in the fifties the couple have a child and shortly thereafter burn to death as a result of the experiments done on them fast forward some years and the baby is now an adult named sam but naturally he's not a normal person and soon finds when it's discovered that he has the ability to set things on fire at will the film stars brad dourif who must have seemed like a good casting choice given his success with child's play two years earlier but actually was an uninspired decision as the central performance is really terrible and not helped by the terrible supporting performances the turgid direction and dull script also don't do the film many favours and the trend of lacking in favours is continued by the special effects which are very unrealistic and have nothing on the films that this one is ripping off all of which were made some years earlier the plot is really slow and it's almost an hour before anything of note happens and i didn't care for it even then it soon becomes obvious which direction the film will go in and it all boils down to the sort of tedious ending you would expect the final confrontation is a big disappointment and nothing is really explained during the film not that any revelation would have been interesting anyway overall this is a rubbish film and another reason why tobe hooper is a long way from being a great horror director see firestarter again instead	negative
deepa mehta's fire is groundbreaking bold and artistic a masterful social commentary on the plight of the women from conservative upper middle class indian households this is a film no one should miss shabana azmi and nandita das give stellar performances by underplaying their characters as much as possible a r rahman's music is the work of the genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film mehta uses rahman's score and together they create such amazing sound montages that effectively portray the views of the world around radha and sita whenever they look to each other for support this film is not about lesbianism as many have branded it lesbianism is just a part of the film it is unfortunate that most people tend to write the film off calling it taboo instead of giving it a chance and looking at its real meaning	positive
this is one of the greatest child pet movies ever created i cry every time i see shadow yelling wait wait for me peter as the family car is pulling away this is a must see if you love animals best movie ever the lines in the movie are sometimes stupid like when sassy says to chance cat's rule and dogs drool lines like this i could do without but when i was six i bet i loved that line the storyline may seem hooky to some but i like it shadow as the older dog who's preparing chance to take over for him when he's gone is really moving when you think about it it reminded me of my childhood dog i think everyone can find a piece of themselves in homeward bound	positive
i remember this movie quite intense for an 11 year old good editing i felt terrible for the st bernard i'd watch it again if it were rebroadcast but the signal is passing pluto as i write this robert culp a highlight of his career i am just glad i didn't live in that neighborhood oh those 70's what a decade if they remade it i bet it would be very violent and bloody so what are they waiting for an excellent movie for pre pubescent suburban boys it was very intense i think it was filmed in los angeles certainly not made in lodi nj the shot with the st bernard was the best and obviously the most haunting image from the film and then they left the carcass on the stoop rotten kids	positive
the soloist has all ingredients to impress the academy its director joe wright has already authored a best picture candidate the leading actor robert downey jr starred in a widely praised superhero film finally the movie itself is a drama when it was mysteriously pulled from release in late 2008 filmgoers and critics were baffled now that i've seen it i assure you universal didn't just delay this film to promote iron man oscar buzz the soloist is a weak drama with no external conflict that is vastly inferior to any 2009 best picture candidates downey and co star jamie fox aren't to be blamed for this mishap joe wright is largely at fault but even he can't save a lifetime story many movies are too complex and alienate viewers this one is unusually simple it's a movie about a newspaper reporter steve lopez downey who befriends a homeless musician nathaniel ayers jamie fox that's it ayers is schizophrenic and doesn't resonate with lopez's traditional approach to friendship the two become friends they begin this movie as acquaintances and are bffs by its end tension consists of moments like this will ayers let lopez take him to the homeless shelter this material would have been better suited as a made for tv production rather than a feature film wright includes many scenes of cheap humor to obscure the lack of content lopez battles yard defiling raccoons in what i consider a sub plot do you remember when this happened in atonement or pride and prejudice those films were structured enough to permit an occasional joke but nothing so prolonged ayers' back story is fleshed out when it doesn't need to be worst of all these scenes are not connected and appear at random intervals it's a way of admitting that the main story carries little appeal nathaniel was a violin prodigy with a tough upbringing i was too this is a fabricated attempt to create sympathy with ayers when most of us already have it he's a homeless schizophrenic for crying out loud the movie somewhat conveys humanity's love for music like amadeus and beethoven lives upstairs it isn't as effective as either of those pictures however the entire film is hinged on ayers' schizophrenia it ultimately is how he interacts with everyone else his being a musician is a nice touch but hardly worth including the film doesn't incorporate this characteristic fully into his persona take music out of amadeus or beethoven lives upstairs and no film remains the soloist is more about friendship in general than music nathaniel could be a writer or film critic and few lines of dialog would need to be seriously altered this is only joe wright's third film and his first that isn't a romance staring keira knightley let's hope this film isn't an indication of how limited his abilities are there are stylistic nods to his earlier works but the soloist is much weaker than either of them in his defense universal should not have agreed to widely release this picture this film seems tailored for imagine entertainment distributors of changeling i wouldn't be so disappointed with it if had a limited release its poor box office performance may inhibit better dramas from being distributed nationally	negative
i probably doubled my knowledge of iran when i saw secret ballot 2001 now i know about four times as much i doubt i learned a whole heck of a lot from not without my daughter 1991 offside is a splendid budget iranian comedy about a group a girls working individually to attend a decisive soccer match for their country's place in the world cup women are not allowed to attend soccer matches so the nation's armed forces have been mobilized to save any women who try to enter from themselves some teen girls try to crash the party by dressing as boys but are caught the movie is mostly set at this holding pen where the girls are detained by soldiers awaiting some unspecified punishment although the girl who dressed as a soldier claims that she was one insignia away from being executed the movie explores the absurdity of the situation the thinking that bars women from football matches comes down to it being too raunchy an experience for the fairer sex a philosophy not unknown in the west less than 100 years ago this farce comes to a head when a girl needs to go to the bathroom so a soldier escorting her demands that she cover her eyes so she can't see the graffiti the conflict is not entirely about the battle of the sexes at one point some friction arises between a solider who is rural and the girls who are urban fortunately this movie was not too culturally esoteric that the comedy was lost on this neighbour and cultural cousin of the great satan you have to be in the mood for it but no one should avoid this movie because they think that they won't get it	positive
this could have been a really good movie if someone would just have known how to finish the film the story was going along just fine and heading towards that point in every movie like this where the gray characters turn good and the bad guys get their just desserts and boom it's like they ran out of script and the cast just started to make things up which wouldn't have been so bad if the cast had just continued with the character development they had already put in place but such is not the case and the movie soon becomes a goofy mess my advice is to watch this movie up to about the last 30 minutes and then shut it off at this point imagine how you think the next 30 minutes will look based on what you have seen so far believe me the ending you come up with will look far better than how this film actually ends trust me on this	negative
this film moved me at age 39 in the same way that all the footage and coverage of dogtown affected me when i was 13 for all of those who criticized the self promotion of the z boys interviewed they have the last laugh on you that was their whole deal we're better than all of you and here's why insert footage of the smoothest pool carve imaginable this was a film to tell their story and that was their story whether you like it or not it was their opinion of their skating that mattered not yours or mine i thought the film captured their attitude and influence exactly as i remembered it in the 70's the reality is that they did revolutionize skateboarding they were the impetus behind extreme sports and they did inject a cultural paradigm that reached into every corner of americana this movie gave rebirth to images of bertleman on a wave and alva and jay adams ripping up the coping that was the california dream to an entire culture of young american teenagers that just wanted to have fun and get rad as i watched this film i realized that it was these images that i lived with every day until i was old enough to move out and back down to so cal after my family had moved to nor cal when i was five until i could get back my buddies and i built and thrashed ramp after ramp searched for every empty pool possible and mimicked everything stecyk covered about these guys we are all educated and have family's and careers now but this film reminds me who i was at that age and why i still surf this is an inspired film that anyone who has an interest in pop culture extreme sports the 70's or even just good documentary film making will enjoy completely whenever it comes on cable i can't change the channel kudos to stacy peralta for making a beautiful piece of art	positive
this film was shrouded in scandal for so long that it became a very sought after item the outrage the mystery etc it had everything to be a great piece of film making but ultimately fails in every extent it's a terribly bad comedy a pathetic horror movie a lame erotic film the 2 disc dvd includes a gorgeous booklet with stills interviews essays on bestiality etc as well as an extensive interview with the more than pretentious director for those who have heard about it but never seen it the package will seem fantastic until one actually sees the film disc 1 contains the edited film badly translated to english but with good visual quality disc 2 contains the director's cut in an awful transfer in french what can i say about the actual beast a hand puppet of kermit the frog would have been more effective and shocking	negative
i've seen better production quality on youtube i pity the actors as the writing was terrible and the direction shocking not sure how they could get the lines out i really doubt any actor would have been able to salvage this movie no matter how good they were the characters were not developed at all and there was no real cohesion in the plot which just seemed to go nowhere much it's a shame really as the premise for the movie was good and with better production quality direction and script it could have been a decent movie it certainly was not a comedy unless you laugh out loud at the dubbing which was amateurish even the english actors sounded weird	negative
boogie nights is a masterpiece it tells a great story with flair an great direction from a very talented director this film features a cast which turn in outstanding performances though the subject matter is very controversial but it is handled with great care by very talented people this movie has an unexpected emotional impact also you will remember it long after it is over	positive
this was bollywood's answer to fatal attraction and this is a classic film in its own right juhi chawla was good and so was sunny deol but it was shah rukh khan who shot to fame as the stalker since then he has become a favourite of the chopra's dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge mohhabatein dil to pagal hai veer zaara and chak de india shah rukh at first appears to be a villain but then towards the end you start to sympathize with him the scripting was superb and the songs were chartbusters my favourites are too mere samne and jaadu teri nazar after the dismal failure of the underrated lamhe yash chopra fought back with darr the dialogues were memorable the k k kiran dialogue is often repeated since darr yash chopra has slipped bit dil to pagal hai was bad but he redeemed himself slightly with veer zaara which was far far better this was yash chopra's last masterpiece	positive
necessary roughness 1991 was a bad comedy drama that tried to hard on every level to be a serious film about college football a lot of current and former superstar athletes appeared in this production during one of the film's comedic highlights other than that it's a very mediocre movie they should have just stuck to making a straight out comedy filled with no realism instead the film makers try to play both fields and they end up on the short end of the stick when will somebody make a decent film about college football that's funny and realistic not recommended unless it's for free on t v	negative
this is a cut above other movies of the genre genuinely suspenseful intelligent brilliantly acted and visually stunning yes the plot can be confusing but that's partly what makes it pack such a punch watch it twice if you can you'll get almost as much out of watching it when you know the twist than you do from watching it the first time don't be put off by the fact that this film comes from korea a country not too familiar to most western audiences while there are elements of the film that are culturally specific the underlying themes are all too universal guilt anger loss madness and retribution all of these are handled superbly by lim su jeong as su mi the lead character also worthy of particular mention is yum jung ah who delivers a deeply creepy and unsettling performance as the stepmother while it has its scary moments this is not really a horror flick as most people would imagine it it's more a psychological suspense story with an element of mystery it grips you from the start and will keep you guessing until the end and possibly beyond	positive
although the likeliness of someone focusing on this comment among the other 80 for this movie is low i feel that i have to say something about this one i am not the kind of movie watcher who pays attention to production value thought provoking dialog or brilliant acting directing however i claim that this movie sucks i don't know why i don't like it i mean it has almost everything i want out of a horror movie blood outrageousness unintentional humor etc according to this evidence it should be my favorite still zombi 3 is a baaad movie there are just too many things that compels you to yell at the screen like when the girl leaves the army guy when their car breaks down to find water this spoils nothing so don't worry she walks into what i see as an abandoned hotel or something did she not see that there was a friggin' lake in the middle of the building yes she's looking for water and passes up a lake why cuz she wants to know why the people who aren't there cuz the place is abandoned won't answer her when she calls out is anybody there oh this is just a little insignificant piece of the big picture i'm painting there is a reason though why i gave this film more than 1 star it's one of those movies where if you forget how bad it really is like i have a few times you'll want to watch it again because it's just so over the top in every aspect i called it blood in the first paragraph but this movie has no blood it has an ocean of gore also it has pretty weird creatures in it as well a zombie baby with an adult size hand and a magically flying head to name just two you know when you try to think of the worst and cheesiest movies ever made and you come up with '50's sci fi movies i believe that zombi 3 and movies like it should top those it has all the elements scientists arguing with the government warnings of the apocalypse on the radio armies battling monsters and so on this is the plan 9 of the '80's while i won't say that this is a waste of money if you want to buy it just expect the very worst and when you find out that expecting the worst is underestimating zombi 3 it won't be all that bad you might actually like it i'm not saying that's impossible don't think i hate this movie i don't really oh p s killing birds aka zombie 5 rules did i just blow my credibility	negative
i saw this film at the toronto film festival where it received a standing ovation this film tells a story that to my knowledge has never been told before namely about the rosenstrasse a street in berlin uprising of german gentile women who were married to jews at the end of the second world war as such it is a unique story and what's more is the only film about the holocaust that i have ever seen that shows that there were good germans the helping family in anne frank for instance was dutch who did not support the nazis and in fact had the fortitude to stand up against their own country's immorality and brutality during the nazi regime at the risk of their very lives the acting is great across the board the framing story in new york interesting and intricate the direction from von trotta masterful in every scene and the production values including the gorgeous cinematography outstanding of course the family in new york could be speaking german many immigrants in this country choose to speak in their native tongue with their family a common occurrence so that criticism is unwarranted to say more would spoil the experience the film is long but i did not look at my watch once i am hoping this film gets some distribution is north america for not only is this film a masterpiece but it can actually help heal any animosity people have towards the germans because of their support of hitler if this film is playing in your area i urge you to see it you will be glad you did	positive
gi samurai sees sonny chiba and some other guys get transported back to civil war stricken feudal japan for no particular reason and much carnage ensues it's a rather over the top essay of sword vs machine gun that ultimately yields some interesting results the plot essentially runs along the rails that you might expect from the title initial fish out the water antics what is this flying metal box etc etc aren't we better off here discussions and ultimately a huge battle the latter is proof that the film doesn't take itself seriously at all the carnage taking up most of the second half as samurai army battles chiba's platoon a face off one would fully expect from the title but it still manages to overwhelm with its inventiveness and extravagance it's certainly one of the most unique battle sequences of its time and doesn't drag despite its extended length chiba gives a gruff performance as iba initially a good leader but someone who finally finds himself questioning his own morals as the situation slowly has an effect on him this is certainly one of his better vehicles from his terrific cv by the final act the two worlds have had such an effect on each other you have to wonder if it was a bit of nihilism on the part of the writers as they seem to be asking weren't we better off back then ' but this is maybe reading a bit much into was can generally be described as a hugely entertaining two hours of almost non stop action	positive

i finally sat down and saw this film the whole way through and i must say i was very impressed michelle rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actresses it's not only the fact that she can act but that she chooses the roles best suited to her that are more meaningful and important than what would first seem i've read a few comments expressing their relief that this was not some awful feminist thing as they thought beforehand but i certainly disagree diana is a feminist she follows her dreams and believes in herself contrary to what practically everyone around her thinks with the exception of her caring brother tiny and her trainer and manager hector who proves to be more a father figure than her real parent which is what the word feminism is all about it's good to see films like this showcasing the true side of feminism that they're not a bunch of manhating losers but that they have dreams and can do anything diana is true to herself while still falling prey to love and she and adrian have a more realistic complicated relationship rather than just something that magically works out girlfight is a true taste of reality and it put some faith back into my perception of people thanks michelle 8 10 a very important movie that's relatable to not just young women but everyone wanting to go far in their lives	positive
a snore gore i saw this piece of horrible stinking worthless junk at the cameo movie house now the famous crobar night club on washington avenue on south beach in 1980 or 81 i was 17 and my three buddies and i laughed at this horrible gross piece of trash the theater was on it's last legs and there were mostly drunks snoring and sleeping in the place they didn't miss a darn thing the worst acting ever these actors deserve the academy award for the worst and i mean worst acting roles in the history of the cinema joke was the theater was showing another mi mi lay a great name at least stinker barf city enough said if you're under 12 years old you might get a few chills over 12 you will be snoring after the opening credits it's just amazing that anyone spent a cent on making this movie and to think it's considered a cult classic yuk	negative
decent action scenes but the movie is saddled with a slow convoluted storyline nearly non existent dialogue that leads to minimal character development and a seriously horrible storyline did i mention that the storyline made no sense but in its defense the action scenes were impressive enough even if they leave you scratching your head as to why they just happened there's not much else to say about the movie it's a slick mindless action adventure that makes no sense whatsoever it's like watching a worse version of the matrix and skipping all the storyline and dialogue	negative
as a nice anecdote to one of the above comments in was in mumbai about two weeks before the release of this movie i was approached being white to dub some of the lines of this movie in a recording studio while i speak german as well i was kindly asked to do all dubbing scenes in english otherwise it would be too confusing for the indian audience so therefore all germans in this movie actually speak english funny enough i did multiple characters so if you would want to actually spoil some time by watching the movie again listen carefully all non indian characters are only done by 4 voices	negative
for fans of 1970s hammer type horror films this movie should be a treat the only thing i didn't like about the film was the fact that peter cushing was wasted on the worst episode in general however this is a solid spooky little movie if this is not amicus' best film it's certainly one of them the best episode rightfully saved for last is the one featuring jon pertwee as a horror film actor it is really excellent as good as pertwee was in this role it's hard to believe he didn't do more of these types of movies all in all this is an entertaining movie which scared the heck out of me as a child and which still gives me the creeps to this day	positive
the only pure life is one that ends with a signature in blood so says mishima anyway a young sheltered boy who becomes a celebrity author the life of one of japans most celebrated literary voices is told from three perspectives his life just before he and four members of his private army take over a japanese military base and commit ritual suicide shown in color flashbacks shown in black and white and scenes from his novels shown in a kind of dreamy technicolor set design somewhere between traditional noh theater and the wizard of oz these stories are often told at the same time but are edited to reinforce the slow fusing of mishima's life with his fictions until the end or the beginning when like the ancient samurai he so admires he will be at a balance of pen and sword when his words and actions are the same and he is a full and pure being paul schrader wrote the screen play for taxi driver and directed cat people a bizarre erotic horror film which left strange impressions on me as a boy and in mishima he comes closest to making a really excellent film whats interesting is to watch the poet the homosexual the shy and awkward man with a low body image who overstates his tuberculosis to get of of ww2 of which he seems forever ashamed become a body building samurai obsessed a sexual media phenomena all the while still writing prolific amounts of novels plays and short stories a short and sweet version is to say mishima has no father and becomes obsessed with masculinity beauty sex and self destruction in some tragic attempt to feel connected to something bigger than himself that he was always missing watching him with his fellow suicidal cadets you see him happy delivering his big paternal speech giving orders and loving the control until the speech itself the point where pen and sword meet of course this ignores the subtlety of the story telling craft here which makes this transformation so natural and remarkable though the story fascinating at times really isn't this movies greatest success the cinematography performances editing music by philip glass and set designs are really what make this worth seeing and more than a traditional bio pic one day i will pick up a mishima book he does seem to have an ear for prose and for staging ideas but for now i'm satisfied with the film those interested in japanese literature and post war culture should check out fans of inventive combinations of facts and fictions should enjoy as well	positive
great movie the sound track is awesome very relaxing sound elton was ahead of his own time even back in 1971 lewis gilbert did a magnificent job producing and directing this film the movie was romantic and a breath of fresh air the sound tracks written by sir elton complimented the movie to a t rex morris does a great job with the tenor sax on the song honey roll and poem i meant to do my work today by richard le gallienne was incredible kudos to everyone involved with this fantastic film it was no surprise that a lot of the people involved with this movie went on to become the best in their field	positive
the cavern 2 out of 10 blair witch meets the cave and gives me a headache i have something to ask all film schools could you please teach future directors how to hold a camera steady flailing the camera around like aunt betty with 12 drinks is headache inducing also film is primarily a visual medium directors may want to point their camera's in the general direction of the action film also requires light to work perhaps a light source should be employed so one can see the action on the screen i know it is a cave movie but there is absolutely nothing frightening about watching pitch blackness for minutes at a time for that matter showing the film upside down doesn't indicate confusion on screen it indicates confusion in the editing booth a last note to the director i'm sure there was a good reason to have a horribly fake cgi campfire i honestly can't for the life of me think of one now on to the screenwriter try to make at least one character likable i'd prefer two or more but one decent person i can root for or care about might help also if you are going to have flashbacks make them relevant to the story if you are going to have a surprise ending it is probably best if it doesn't contradict every single thing that comes before it and try adding some fancy spelunking terms to a cave movie you might have wanted to start with spelunking the cavern is a pretty bad film poorly shot with a confusing improbable and anticlimactic ending	negative
joe was first released in the us in the summer of 1970 despite respectable notices reasonable box office and an oscar nom it vanished shortly afterwards and remained forgotten about throughout the 1980's before being enthusiastically reappraised somewhat unjustly in the us in the late 90's thanks to this lengthy unavailability its reputation has gone on to see it placed inexplicably alongside the likes of michael winner's original death wish although revenge is a theme a film about vigilantism this most definitely is not the plot isn't worth synopsizing its a flabby hammy and bizarrely stagey ramble about an accidental murder and the unlikely relationship that blossoms out of it that relationship and the largely class based quirks of its two leads are exaggerated into ridiculous caricature these two and their situation bear absolutely no relation to reality almost everything about the film is cantankerous and begrudgingly antiquated which makes the whole thing completely fascinating hippies are depicted as snide and exclusive misanthropes hard drugs either make you sleep or dance around maniacally with lipstick on your face and most young women are prepared to have sex with strangers in exchange for marijuana at the drop of a fly its very much a film of the 60's rather than the 70's so why some industry luminaries have begun to include it in retrospective conversations about the beginnings of the hollywood new wave is a complete mystery martin scorcese of all people even got involved though probably only to give a nod to the dank lavatorial hues of the grim urban cinematography which almost certainly influenced taxi driver four years later but joe seems very much like a furious tirade against the likes of easy rider and bonnie and clyde rather than a continuation of that same insurgent cinematic ethos it isn't a film of any real artistic significance despite joe's incontinent fury at everything in his world it remains a story about absolutely nothing but its value as a cultural museum piece is unprecedented shot on and around the streets of new york city during the darkest hours of the vietnam war and at a time when america and significantly its cinema was being revolutionized to the horror of the old guard the film ends up in its own completely oblivious and accidental way saying more about that period of history than numerous infinitely superior movies that directly endeavored to capture it but as a film despite a really surprising and effective shock ending this is basically a michael winner film but not as well made how does that tickle your fancy incidentally if you are like me a fan of spotting arbitrary background lookalikes then check out harold steptoe at 1 22 11 in the hippy art gallery	negative
i am so confused what in the world was this movie about what was the killer's motivation he seemed quite angry but i have yet to figure out why nothing in this movie made sense it had zero depth or less than zero depth which i guess would make it a hill or a pile of crap the acting was horrible when i searched for a few of the actors in this movie they had been in very few things that i had heard of and that came as absolutely no surprise i can't decide whether to feel sorry for them for the embarrassment of being in a movie this bad or to feel that they should never be offered another acting job again starting now seinfeld reference really though don't waste your time with this there's so little substance that there's nothing there even just to make fun of this was undoubtedly one of the worst slasher flicks no one of the worst flicks of any kind that i have ever had the misfortune to watch and i've seen quite a few	negative
firstly this movie works in the fact that it is disturbing i really did not like seeing all these scenes where people get cut up alive etc the weirdly erotic introduction gives one a sense of necrophiliactic wonder it is somewhat distastefull to me personally but the movie really works in that respect and it is suppposed to be scary so i give it credit for that yup a few points there for those scalpels and well damned disturbing idea of getting disected alive but what this movie lacks is an interesting plot characterization or real surprises the whole teen flick horror genre usually goes in a very simple predictable way lots of 'tense' moments creepy guys who are insane and the big question of all is the boyfriend the murderer this movie fits into the category of scream and countless others which have spawned over the 90s well i won't spoil it for you but it's not exactly interesting who is the killer we find out who it is half way through and from there on the movie drudges on trying to fill in some time rather boringly to say the least i was looking at the clock a bit on this movie the lead actress is great as usual but the carboard acting box she is placed into makes one groan in pain the college girl who is a detective who everyone thinks is insane but she is the one who really knows whats going on and the cops ahhh they just laugh and eat donuts very predictable flat disturbing at times and most of all boring and dull it's like an american film company took a flight to germany to shoot a movie to make it foreign hmmm or did they	negative
roy anderssons du levande is not totally original as it is counter piece to anderssons previous movie sånger från andra våningen still the movie has aura of total originality some conventions of movie making are still thrown away most of the actors look nothing like what you would expect in movie and the shots take long time most of the time camera doesn't move but people move around it the shots start from somewhere and many times the scenery builds up in amazing proportions w g sebald comes to mind in literature with same technique because of the time invested in every shot the suspension is really high in many of the scenes there is a story and isn't it is left for viewer to build up in his or her own mind this movie is positive it is determined not to see this all in negative way and at the same time will not pass the social injustices one of the messages i got from it was that maybe all failures and accidents are not fatal after all great movie	positive
from the beginning of the movie i had a feeling like its a movie about another jason's from friday the 13th and it is dispute that the movie starts interesting but as the times goes by its just a pointless movie about muted supernatural silent serial killer i mean he goes under the guy's bed without making any sound not seen by anyone he was supposed to be blind after failed execution but he walks and kills people like he used to i'm tired of it for me it's all over the same thing in another words unreal too many mistakes and confusing information well scene with tide up woman looked impressive but just at first time for that and for intriguing intro 2 stars	negative
this is absolutely one of the best movies i've ever seen it takes me on a a roller coaster of emotions i laugh and cry and get disgusted and happy and in love all this in a little over two hours of time the actors are all brilliant i have to mention the leading actor of course michael nyquist he does a remarkable job i also admire the actor who plays tore who plays this mentally challenged young man in such a convincing way he sort of reminded me of leonardo di caprios roll in gilbert grape and then there is the most beautiful song in the world gabriella's sång i recommend this for everyone to see and enjoy	positive
what can i say i'm a secret fan of 'over the top' action and horror films especially when it comes with a lot of lots of humour and innuendo but i'm not a fan of snake on a plane there are three potential draws to this film the comedy of the situation the horror and the novelty of hundreds of snakes being of a plane firstly this film isn't written as a tongue in cheek horror or a comedy and there are only 1 or 2 points in the film where you'll smile to yourself if you want to get the feel of the film the trailer genuinely represents the movie a horror secondly if you're expecting a film full of action and shocks you won't be disappointed it doesn't stand out above other movies but it always keeps your attention thirdly although the novelty of snakes of a plane doesn't wear off but you'll leave the cinema thinking what was all the fuss about i know this movie has a high rating but it doesn't add up a many of the reviews where written before the film was released and b the breakdown of user ratings has a lot less variation than normal 77 of people rating the movie 10 10 with only 7 of people giving it 9 10 why such an enormous gap	negative
years ago i found a bargain bin copy of this film for a buck or two in so many ways this is quite fitting as when it was made back in 1933 it was truly a cheaply made film by the poverty row studio majestic however while the film is rather derivative it is still well worth watching and provides a few surprises the story is very very familiar as in some germanic town the people are upset because of some recent deaths that appear to be the work of vampires adding to this familiarity is dwight frye he played renfield in dracula and here he is very very similar though he plays a much more harmless weirdo in this case he's obsessed with his pet bats and people begin to blame him for the deaths the film does a good job of providing some red herrings i e false leads and while it doesn't take a genius to figure out frye may not be responsible the who and why are intriguing and make it very different from the average horror film in addition while the production had little money to speak of it still had some good actors of the day lionel atwill and melvin douglas and it also used universal studios sets at night when they were done filming for the day as a result the film looks pretty good overall though i also thought that as usual fay wray was terrible thought it didn't noticeably detract from the film i have seen her in more movies than most people on imdb and i have come to notice that her characters have no depth she always seems to be cast as the screaming lady and provides little new in each film overall for fans of old horror films this is excellent and worth seeing for people who are not fans of the genre it's probably pretty skip able	positive
katherine heigl marley shelton denise richards david boreanaz even before i knew what this film was about these names were enough to draw me in gorgeous talented and popular these are performers to look out for ok where do i start we already know what the film is about five beautiful girls being targeted by a 'romantic' serial slasher a guy they all turned down at the school dance 13 years ago his trademarks include subtle deaththreats disguised as valentine cards maggot infested chocolates and a bleeding nose his weapon of choice well take a pick axe knife electric powerdrill bow and arrow hot iron etc ok so basically it's a horror movie with a nice twisted sense of sexuality horror movies aren't supposed to be shakespeare but i'm not gonna go there i love horror movies but not all of them this one i adore it's up there with some of my other favorites it's funny sexy and scary the killer's mask is childishly creepy and seeing cupid firing a bow and arrow at a victim is really freaky the acting is topnotch denise richards marley shelton and david boreanaz are a lot of fun i really did wish to see much much more of katherine heigl i am one of her biggest fans and would love to see her doing some leading work soon jessica capshaw is a very capable actress and jessica cauffiel gets to do the ditzy blonde role she perfected in urban legend 2 the smaller parts were also good hedy buress was a hoot 'bleedmedry com' and that younger version of denise richards looked frightfully like her highlights every death scene had a particular distinction to it the creepiest being the opening scene in the morgue the hottub scene while ludicrous was well done and the audiovisual maze was sinister the soundtrack is great with creepy music and some fine alternative tunes lowpoint i felt as though the killer wasn't featured enough we barely saw the mask and it wasn't featured at all during the climax i also thought the climax was really unfocused but fun nonetheless the twist at the end wasn't that big of a surprise but i'm really glad that the filmmakers decided to spare us that whole 'explaining killer' routine i don't like to tell people which movies they should see but if someone asked me to pick a horror movie that i thought was really worth seeing then valentine would be it my rating 10 10 bullseye	positive
my first question after seeing this film was why is the title liam if the intent was to tell a story from the boy's perspective it was not carried out well of course there was the formulaic use of camera angles in the boy's scenes but much of the crucial action took place outside of his field of view having a main character unable to speak obviously suggesting the mute powerless position of a child makes it difficult to give that character much depth melodrama is defined as dramatic or other literary work characterized by the use of stereotyped characters exaggerated emotions and language simplistic morality and conflict liam fits this definition to a t the viewer is hit over the head with the typical stereotypes of the fire and brimstone catholic church in the stern school marm and the well fed priest squeezing money from parishioners a stereotype which is becoming very tiresome what's more the jewish characters are money lenders and factory owners much of the film was predictable who didn't think that we'd see theresa scrubbing the toilet after her mother had told her no daughter of mine will scrub another woman's toilet i'm a fan of british realism if it's done well in my opinion liam is not	negative
what are the movies i mean what are movies made for shootings killings no they are made for life stories and this is what this movie does it presents how the life has changed between two ages the father and a son the father being in a need of a job and asking the son for help although there is another generation there are some characteristics which remain including the caress for the family the main subject is in my opinion the love of the son to the father and vice versa the movie is consisted of only one dialog but that dialog is more than i could ever wanted this movie is a pure art once again after marfa si banii cristi puiu delivers us another beautiful movie well done	positive
the best way to have fun in this movie is to count how many clichés it is rehashing snarling chinese gangsters a female vice president a ventilator duct that happens to be big enough to fit a big caucasian male shooting through the wall to kill the bad guy a situation where you need to snuff out some innocent people to prevent armageddon independence day scenes where you snuff out some memorable landmarks in a fireball the vice president in a nice well lighted room surrounded by subordinates while the chinese premier virtually alone in a dark room with just bit of dim light shining snarling as viciously as the slimy gangsters a lone hero left alone in a ship building airplane whatever wreaking havoc on clueless bad guys with big automatic weapons etc etc etc the second best way is to count how many zeroes you need to put after the decimal to accurately gauge the probability of the film scenario i counted up to 45 a president agreeing to a meeting on board a private vessel the impossibly non overridable command from the nuke box the part where the chinese decided to play shoot 'em up etc etc man the earth is more likely fall into the sun than for this film to happen i admit the film was interesting until the point the evil taiwanese gangsters kidnapped the president then the boredom kicked in suspension of disbelief ceased and i started thinking the fun i'd have torturing this film	negative

despite some occasionally original touches like the virtual sets that provide the background for the victorian interiors featuring ada lovelace and her circle this film falls short and ultimately disappoints newcomer francesca faridany seems talented but is wasted as emmy a character who by mid film is reduced to nothing more than staring at a monitor watching lady ada narrate an autobiography 'conceiving ada' takes off briefly when lady ada tilda swinton appears the camera lingers on her facial expressions mannerisms even making her appear to be translucent or momentarily invisible apporting into scenes to dramatize emmy's virtual rendering of her a straightforward biopic of ada lovelace would have been worthwhile but this film unfortunately makes a hash of both lady ada's life and that of a modern day computer scientist and her broadly drawn doltish boyfriend	negative
this is a poem on film wonderfully presented and photographed with sensitive artistry it captures the atmosphere of the time and place perfectly italy's lake district in the twenties it's a love story with a twist the characters are unique and believable the settings are deliciously exotic some of the scenes the funeral boat in the fog the high long shot of the chess table in the centre of an intricately patterned tile floor are beautiful images and rather than the mandatory happy ending this story has a bitter sweet one if film is an art this is close to a masterpiece	positive

i remember this movie from when i was 12 it was amazing i remember it to the day not like most thing i watched back then i have even tried to buy it but its like rocking horse sh t anyway the acting is a bit chewy but the story is amazing considering it was a real b movie with a low budget and event the fighting scenes were amazing to watch i must have watched it about 20 times it was a very well made movie and i loved the idea of fighting giant man controlled robots pity they had to spoil it by making a crappy spin off crash and burn don't watch that movie by the way it is total pants if your a real sci fi movie fan then watch this if it was re made today it would be a winner i really would love to see a remake or even release the dvd of it	positive
at least during its first half if it had started out with the three buddies in the navy and concentrated on the naval action scenes it would have been a much better and tighter film the second half of the film is worth it especially for the action sequences and close up shots of early 20th century ships but it's like a dull toothache getting there also don't watch this film just because ginger rogers is in it she has an important role but it's a small one the film starts out showing three new york city buddies working the tourist trade and also in good natured competition for the hand of sally ginger rogers a singing candy salesgirl along the avenue world war i breaks out the three buddies seem completely indifferent to the struggle yet enlist in the navy anyways the one of the three with the least industry as a civilian bill boyd as baltimore winds up the commanding officer to the other two robert armstrong as dutch and james gleason as skeets to make matters more complex sally has fallen in love with one of the three but doesn't have the chance to tell him before the three sail off to war the film is a little more interesting on board ship mainly because of the close shots we have of the ship itself and also because the chemistry among the three buddies is believable however james gleason at age 49 looks a bit long in the tooth to be a swabby especially when the sign at the enlistment office said you had to be between 17 and 35 to be eligible one real obvious flaw in the film that made me believe that everything outside the naval scenes was slapped together with minimum care is the costume design or i should say the lack of it in the scenes in new york just prior to wwi we have everyone dressed in the fashions of 1931 and everyone driving the cars of 1931 no effort was taken to bring this film into period in conclusion if you watch the few scenes with ginger rogers in them and the last 45 minutes involving the naval suicide mission you've seen everything here worth seeing the rest is padding	negative
if anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to with conversation character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new better and different those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing directing and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in italy and england other days other times funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment made in 1992 with alfred molina joan plowright polly walker josie lawrence jim broadbent miranda richardson and michael kitchens in the major roles under the brush stroke direction of mike newell these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter's eye reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character and the viewer too an artistic telegram on the importance of caring about those around us	positive
my wife and i saw this movie once in 1989 and enjoyed it so much we wanted to see it again it was so moving that i was calling it a tear jerker the mystery that billings was sent to report on is really no mystery at all angles it seems that ever time he turned around something happened to him all good and i believe it scared george a bit considering that he did not realize what he had gotten into it just goes to show that even the cold hearted can change with the right attitude around if only we all could treat each other the same the world would be a better place to date we have been searching the net for a copy of it now i finally have a connection to it as soon as i can find a copy to buy i am going to grab it	positive
satya was excellent company was just as good but more polished probably owing to the money earned from previous movies ab tak chappan however is even more entertaining the dialogue is gritty crude and at times hilarious nana pataker shines yet again in a role that only he can fulfill with authority but the supporting cast are very talented direction is tight and the story evolves at a satisfying pace with a very dramtic climax as a depiction of reality it may be over dramatised but at the end of the day it's a movie so the balance is spot on i've ordered my dvd and can't wait to see it again at home as a lover of these type of gangster flicks this is very gratifying and comes highly recommended for the refreshingly non yash raj bollywood gangster flick lovers out there	positive
i watched this film mistakenly thinking that it was that other radio station zombie flick the shonky production values and low rent cast soon gave away that this was another one of the those cheap sci fi channel style knock offs the central performance from bill moseley is initially quite engaging as the dubious radio shock jock but as the film goes on becomes less and less convincing as he is actually required to act the rest of the cast have little to do other than look concerned and have no depth whatsoever the cinematography is dull flat and completely uninspired like so many of these kind of films it doesn't even manage a decent bit of convincing gore the zombie make up is literally pathetic apart from one notable exception towards the end of the film the film tries to inject originality and a message into it's concoction of half baked and ripped off ideas by somehow equating this outbreak with intolerance towards islam and the war on terror this is woefully handled with all the intellectual clout of a 6 year old as the characters and seemingly the writers are unable to distinguish the difference between race and religion describing all people of a certain skin colour as muslims most notably one character is revealed to be muslim by skin colour alone at the same time the muslim terrorists who cause the outbreak are the usual psychopathic stereotype presumably the far far superior pontypool had a similar budget as dead air yet shines everywhere where this film fails miserably	negative
after i saw la pianiste several years ago i said to myself that i would never see it again so powerful and disturbing it was time went on but i could not get the movie and its main character erika kahut out of my mind the story of a respected piano teacher in vienna conservatory cool and collected on the surface an expert in classical music with the inner world so dark and disturbing with the demons of fear self loathing and self destruction strong enough to ruin her demanded more than one viewing i read the book the piano teacher by elfriede jelinek the controversial nobel prize winner in literature that the film is based on and after reading it i saw the film again second time all pieces of puzzle came to the right places not very often an outstanding harrowing book is transferred to the screen with such brilliancy as le pianiste three actors gave outstanding performances franz schubert's piano music soaked in the morbid humanity is another bright star of the movie i only have one problem with haneke's vision there is a scene in the film where haneke made some changes to erika's character comparing to the novel in the book the furthest she went to reveal herself to walter the young student in the conservatory who became attracted to her was in a letter as soon as he realized what he was dealing with and showed to her how much he was repulsed by that she had stopped communicating with him erika of the book would never chase walter to throw herself to him she kept everything inside she did not like to act she was not a chaser she loved to watch the big scene during the hockey game was not necessary it tried to make erika sympathetic and of course huppert was heartbreaking but it took the mystery that surrounded her jelinek did not write that scene it sounded and looked false in otherwise excellent film	positive
when the employees of a theater find an old reel of film they decide to show it at the midnight screening of night of the living dead assuming it's an old preview reel unfortunately it's actually an old nazi mind control experiment that turns the audience into a horde of mindless shuffling zombies i can't understand the hate for this movie it is a low budget independent production with a lot of camp but it doesn't deserve a 1 1 here on imdb it is just so much fun it is obvious that the filmmakers have a reasonable knowledge and love of old horror movies and they have created an entertaining tribute to them sprinkled with references and homages to a variety of them it has the feel of such things as night of the living dead in many ways very similar evil dead 2 and army of darkness and various others i liked the explanation of how the zombies though really just hypnotized into thinking they are zombies actually come to have the physical attributes of the living dead unbelievable perhaps but i appreciate the effort by the writers to explain it the gore effects were decent for the budget the acting was all right and the story was entertaining i liked it	negative
i'm very disappointed first of all the german synchronization is bad maybe in the original version with subtitles it would have been better but the whole movie looks like if the director saw luna papa and black cat white cat and tried to produce something in this style too but failed in every aspect it's an incongruent mixture of a weird unbelievable story and very childish gags no atmosphere no life extremely primitive sex humor i voted 2 because 1 is the worst and the other point for 'sybilla' she's really cute sorry i like 'eastern' movies but this one is really superfluous	negative
i don't cry easily over movies but i have to admit this one brought me to tears although i am not a ms streep fan her performance was excellent the title defines in a sentence what a mother's love is for the first hour i didn't like any of the characters but that changed as the movie went on the movie also explained why certain marriages last even though there are obstacles a must see film	positive
what a thrill ride twisted and thought provoking once again sharon stone pulls off her drop dead gorgeous spellbinding character of author catherine tramell impeccably the original basic instinct takes place in san francisco the sequel takes place in london where catherine has now relocated both bustling cities known for excitement haute couture and a perfect place for someone like catherine trammel to take residency david morrisey derailed plays the smooth role of psychiatrist dr michael glass the character david thewlis plays as roy washburn with scotland yard is a refreshing departure from his role as lupin in the harry potter series flashy cars designer clothes sex drama humor tension all of the basic instincts mind bending throughout great screenplay from the climactic opening scene to the surprise ending this film is anything but boring everyone in the theater was glued to the screen	positive

balance of terror is still one of the best star trek episodes ever made it was inspired by the film enemy below starring robert mitchum a movie that deals with a cat and mouse game between two captains during world war ii in this episode captain kirk and his crew play similar game with a romulan vessel this is the program that famously introduces the war hungry romulans who are distant relatives of the vulcans it is an incredibly suspenseful episode tightly constructed for maximum effect it is also interesting to see how the episode contains a series of subplots that add extra layers of meaning to the story mark lenard makes his star trek debut as the romulan captain he will later play spock's father ambassador sarek a must see episode	positive
the first thing i wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again because i'd missed lots with all the laughing i did i'm european and i've studied abroad and i've as good as lived with spanish french italian and german people the film was full of stereotypes which more often than not p people off and reading some of the other reviews i see that it did p people off but this film gets the stereotypes so right i cannot fault it except for maybe the way the french guy became a drunken party animal the english guy was the perfect geezer stereotype drunk annoying insulting but shines through in the end as well as the stereotypes the film also got the emotional aspect of studying abroad correct at first he's shy doesn't know anybody misses home doesn't know his way around as time progresses it becomes his home and when the time comes to leave it is extremely difficult a feeling people can only understand if they've experienced it i highly recommend this film	positive
and it's a not very good documentary either american movie seems to have confused some people into thinking this is a spoof documentary mockumentary and even some newspaper tv listings described it as such i'll not laugh out loud at that because it's easy to mistake this documentary as one big wind up ala this is spinal tap what seems to have caused the confusion is that the documentary centres around budding film maker mark borchardt who is how can i put it rather self deluded yes but that's not necessarily a bad thing since if we had no dreams we'd all still be living in caves and the fact that mark is obsessed with horror movies is not to be taken as a criticism since both sam raimi yes that one and peter jackson yes that one both started out doing low budget horror comedies so again it's not a criticism no it's just that mark borchardt yes that one is a parody of american trailer trash remember in there's something about mary ben stiller gives a lift to a dodgy hitch hiker come into my office because you're f in' fired well that's who mark resembles along with most of jerry springer's guests so it's very easy to see why some people thought this wasn't a real documentary it's also not a very good documentary since mark and co give me the creeps did you know that someone thought mark would grow up to be a serial killer does anyone else think there's plenty of time left for this to happen	negative
watchable little semi soaper but hardly captivating still two or three funny moments what amazes me is how slippery and morally highly questionable mcnicol is she plays an invalid a leg problem yet she not only isn't the ugly duckling whom men shun but she is even a man eater and we are supposed to feel for her oh poor little mcnicol with her leg problem poor little mcnicol she is constantly getting passes from men and even dumps them without so much as blinking at one occasion she even has a premeditated one night affair with a blond stud and then she tells her newly found french girlfriend quite non chalantly that it took him time to get an erection makes us viewers wonder why she is so leg conscious if every guy wants to hump her well almost every guy the only guy who really shunned her after seeing her leg wrapped up in metal is the guy working on the telephone but otherwise she seems to be doing just fine with men no shyness no lack of success with men and she throws them away like toys the way she dumped carradine was ridiculous poor little invalid girl i don't think so and yet we are meant to believe that this woman has a major confidence problem hence the scene in which she prepares to start playing the flute for a solo concert and somehow manages to throw the notes on the ground out of nervousness nervousness the rest of the movie shows little or nothing that would suggest that she has confidence problems so this flute scene is absurd and doesn't fit into the bigger picture i was also surprised how quickly and eagerly mcnicol makes friends with a french woman who is screwing a married guy on the surface the movie would appear to be a sentimental story of one crippled woman's struggle for acceptance or something like that but it's nothing like that at all the writer clearly shifts between this type of movie and a screw anything that moves it's the 80s kind of movie very confusing as far as her leg it's not like she has a big fat purple balloon growing on her calf muscle she only has a normal looking metal prosthetic attached to the lower part of her leg so i really don't understand why the makers of the film try to make it seem as if she is a female quasimodo or something at the beginning of the film it's not like she has a twin head growing out of her neck though mcnicol is hardly a major catch kind of cutish but nothing special quite average but what the hell is carradine doing playing some kind of a relatively smooth guy flirting with mcnicol and her pal this guy was in revenge of the nerds but i guess it's the same thing with the carradines in the movies as it is with the kennedys in politics no matter how ugly unable or dumb all the doors are open for a career in movies and politics respectively down with nepotism if you want to read bogus biographies about the carradines and other hollywood nepotists and morons contact me by e mail	negative
another american pie movie has been shoved down our throats and this one is the worst one of them all it doesn't deserve the name american pie they should have stopped at the wedding this movie feels like just a stupid porn movie which they slapped the title american pie on when i was watching this i felt like i was watching a different series it doesn't fell like american pie at all it has different humor and it is much more rude and has many more sex scenes then the other american pie movies i don't recommend it ever actually i don't recommend any of the american pie presents movies just stick with the nice original trilogy 2 10	negative
it's out of question that the real anna anderson was not princess anastasia apart from very distinctive differences in physical appearance anderson's eyes are perceivably larger lips thicker nose larger and turned up at the end etc anderson's unable to speak russian was a ridiculous tell that's why i detest anna anderson and her confederates so much not a lot of swindlers have the audacity and endurance to scam for 60 years with such a blatantly untenable scheme yet to some extent i have sympathy for anna anderson life must have been hard for a young polish peasant worker in those days and to impersonate another woman for 60 years is an arduous task for anybody she had to hold back her fleshy lips all the time to mimic the thin lips of anastasia's and had to occasionally go lunatic to make people believe all her chaotic memory was just a result of mental problem anna anderson was an awesome woman on a wrong track had she put her good looks learned elegance endurance acting skills into proper use she could of made a first class actress on a side note some main characters of this two parter seem to be loosely based on real figures prince erich could be a mixture of gleb botkin believed by many the most possible brain behind the whole scheme duke george and dmitri of leuchtenberg and several other figures and darya romanoff seem to be based on the gorgeous princess xenia georgievna romanova but unlike the real confederates prince erich was motiveless in this show and supported anna out of love for and sincere belief in her which is touching on the whole this is a great show fictionalised a bit but still remains faithful to the reality the power of amy irving's acting lies in that she successfully represented anderson's self assuredness the mixture of impersonating others and being herself is intriguing just as princess xenia said about anderson she was herself at all times and never gave the slightest impression of acting a part highly recommended	positive
i can't believe that i actually sat thru this entire film a friend rented it because the jacket made it sound good in it's defense the jacket was correct there was a supposed haunted room that someone slept in overnight from the jacket it sounded like this was on par with freddy jason or maybe the shining it couldn't be farther from the truth if you are a fan of minimalist and or surrealist films you may enjoy it if you're looking for a good fright movie or a couple of thrills go rent jason vs freddy iv you'll have a much better night	negative
this scary and rather gory adaptation of stephen king's great novel features outstanding central performances by dale midkiff fred gwynne who sadly died few years ago and denise crosby and some really gruesome gore effects director mary lambert has a wonderful sense of visual style and manages to make this one of the few versions of king's work that is not only worth seeing but genuinely unnerving the depiction of the zombie child gage miko hughes later in new nightmare is equally noteworthy as what could easily have been a laughable character is made menacing and spooky as for the people who think that this one isn't scary watch it alone in the dark eventually with your squeamish girlfriend and i guarantee you that pet sematary will creep you out some horror movies like this one or the texas chain saw massacre shouldn't be watched in group recommended for horror fans	positive

i concur with everyone above who said anything that will convince you to not waste even a briefest of moments watching this amazingly amateurish movie very poor acting offhand production values utterly pedestrian direction and a script so inept and inane it should never have been written let alone produced even hollywood professionals apparently go to work just for a paycheck although no one should have been paid for this bad work careers should instead have ended over this inconsequential drivel oth there is something fascinating about watching something so jaw droppingly bad and chad lowe is terrifically and consistently bad	negative
much about love life can be learned from watching the folks at the shop around the corner ernst lubitsch had another quiet triumph added to his credit with this lovely film with sparkling dialogue courtesy of his longtime collaborator samson raphaelson and wonderful performances from a cast of abundantly talented performers he created a truly memorable movie always believing in playing up to the intelligence of his viewers and favoring sophistication over slapstick the director concocted a scintillating cinematic repast seasoned with that elusive enigmatic quality known as the lubitsch touch ' although the story is set in budapest and there is a jumble of accents among the players this is of no consequence the beautiful simplicity of the plot is that any great american city or small town could easily be the locus for the action jimmy stewart margaret sullavan are wonderful as the clerks in love with romance and then with each other without knowing it their dialogue so adeptly handled as to seem utterly natural perfectly conveys their confusion quiet desperation as they seek for soul mates theirs is one of the classic love stories of the cinema cherubic frank morgan has a more serious role than usual that of a man whose transient importance in his little world is shattered when he finds himself to be a cuckold an accomplished scene stealer he allows no emotion to escape unvented additionally morgan provides the film with its most joyous few moments near the end when he determines that his store's newest employee an impoverished youth enjoys a memorable christmas eve joseph schildkraut adds another vivid depiction to his roster of screen portrayals this time that of a toadying sycophantic lothario who thoroughly deserves the punishment eventually meted out to him gentle felix bressart has his finest film role as a family man who really can not afford to become involved in shop intrigues yet remains a steadfast friend to stewart sara haden graces the small role of a sales clerk william tracy is hilarious as the ambitious errand boy who takes advantage of unforeseen developments to leverage himself onto the sales force in tiny roles charles halton plays a no nonsense detective and edwin maxwell appears as a pompous doctor movie mavens will recognize mary carr mabel colcord both uncredited in their single scene as miss sullavan's grandmother aunt	positive

this is a slightly uneven entry with one standout sequence involving an over the hill gang reminiscing in the diner that once thirty years previously was their hideout one ho hum duologue between two ageing rock musos a noirish kidnap turned on its head and an opening sequence plus epilogue involving heist artist wannabe edward baer and current 'hot' property anna magloulis which has its moments no movie in which jean rochefort appears can be dismissed lightly and here he shines as one of the over the hill quintet indeed the film is worth seeing for rochefort alone but each of the sequences has something to offer and it's definitely worth a look	positive
i recently watched caprica again and thought i might as well come and write up a review i first saw this right after i saw the series finale of battlestar galactica being a big drooling fan boy of the show left me clinging onto anything i could of the shows universe so i didn't know what to expect but i did come out with a smile though i must admit the story starts off dramatically on planet of caprica and we are introduced with a variety of interesting characters i won't give too much away but there is a dramatic event that dictates the course of the story but i suggest you watch this must say esai morales is one hell of an actor he pulled off a young joseph adama father of the admiral in battlestar galactica i found his acting spot on and i could believe that he is the father of william adama from bsg also eric stoltz fits his role precisely special note it was good to see polly walker outside of rome don't sit down and watch caprica with the expectation of it being like battlestar galactica because the story line is pretty straight forward and anyone can watch it without having to have see bsg this show is a well written drama for those who like there drama with a bit of a sci fi kick	positive
this is a good enough movie and you probably won't be disappointed but it again has roy scheider right after he did french connection playing a cop with the name 'buddy' they also use the same too memorable wheelman from bullitt at first you'll think you've seen the car chase before if you have his face still in your memory the car chase is a great one but as in many car movie scenes it has some technical and editing errors check puppet on a chain and french connection ii for some other good long intense chases	positive

i saw this movie with some indian friends on christmas day the quick summary of this movie is must avoid jp dutta wrote directed produced and edited this movie and did none of these jobs well the movie tells the story of the attempt by pakistan in 1999 to capture part of the disputed region of kashmir from india supposedly based on fact you get a hint from this movie of the difficulty the indian army had in recapturing the area from the pakistani troops who occupied the high ground but instead of telling what must have been a compelling and heroic story all this movie does is make the indian military look laughable and stupid which i know is not true i watched this movie with an almost completely indian audience who were very patriotic and clearly wanted to like this movie but also found themselves laughing at scenes that weren't meant to be funny the script was absolutely abysmal it gave the impression that mr dutta knows nothing about how an army operates and was using bad war movies for reference the result is a script that is brainless and repetitive the acting from most of the principals was not stellar but considering the script they were given i find it hard to criticise them too much as for the supporting cast all i can say is that i hope they were amateurs the editing was also pretty bad it was pretty hard to follow what was going on for a lot of the time and music would abruptly end at scene changes good things the cinematography was pretty good although it was hurt a little by the fact that the movie didn't appear to be colour corrected the colour balance often varied significantly within scenes also the few songs that were in the movie were quite enjoyable for the first half a dozen or so verses at least unfortunately they went on a lot longer than they should have and the worst crime of all this mess is four hours long there is enough here that a good editor could almost squeeze a good 1 5 2 hour movie out of what was shot sadly a good editor was not working on this movie	negative

this is a kind of genre thing meaning you either like the 1950s musicals or you don't if you do you'll love this personally i prefer the 1930s and most of the '40s musicals with the dancing talents of astaire and rogers and eleanor powell bill robinson ruby keeler james cagney shirley temple and so forth but the songs of the '50s the slower dance numbers and the soapy melodramas of the decade all turn me off this film is a case in point the first song was okay but the next three did nothing for me by then the story didn't have much appeal either the presence of deborah kerr is another minus i don't think i've seen a movie she starred in that i liked including this one where the goody two shoes english teacher she portrays spends half the movie threatening to leave siam i which she had however divorcing myself from likes and dislikes there is no denying this rogers and hammerstein production has a lot of appeal to many folks particularly those who liked the sound of music a decade later there are similarities in the r h musicals thus if you liked the julie andrews flick you should like this too this is a lavish production with yes a capital l this is the kind of big production musicals you rarely saw after that generation you also get the dubbed singers unlike today where the actress isn't able to really sing so marnie nixon comes to rescue of kerr as she did with natalie wood in west side story and audrey hepburn in my fair lady yul brynner is king mongkut and is the stereotypical traditionalist the kind filmmakers always portray in a negative way he isn't progressive as the left wingers like the say but the education teacher kerr as anna leonowens will set him straight secular progressives of today always place teachers higher than people trying to cure cancer however yul is good in this role and even employs some comedy along with his more bark than bite character justifiably he is the big star of this film brynner had magnetism even in the magnificent seven yul was the one cowboy who mesmerized the audience in summary it's a fine movie for its day and millions of people enjoyed it i'll leave it at that	negative

ll cool j performed much better in this movie that i expected he did a fabulous job acting as a renegade cop within a renegade department from the very beginning he does a great job of building viewer empathy for his character and the predicament he's in he acts as a sort of gentle giant a person whose rough exterior can scare anybody yet whose heart is clearly in the right place from the very start and he does an amazing job he was quite clearly the best character in the movie this was certainly a performance that will not win morgan freeman any awards after starring in powerhouse films like the shawshank redemption this film was certainly a step down his role in edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor and in terms of the conglomeration of characters placed him sadly on a back burner there are so many ways his character moses ashford could have taken a more pivotal role that he didn't was disappointing and a true let down i was hoping to see more from him in this film timberlake ought to have stayed in the music industry his portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and unpersuasive this movie is a typical action movie that at least initially bears some resemblance to corrupt police affairs la has experienced in the past being an action movie it has its share of shoot em up scenes blood and guts these scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable watching the beginning of the movie there is very little suspense as to what will happen at the end think of what you would typically expect in a good cops bad cops conflict and it bears little resemblance to a real police shoot out what irked me most was the way timberlake's character behaved during shoot out scenes he starts out having guns and not using them then when he finally gets around to using one he fires it as if he's been firing a gun his whole life then he runs out of bullets and doesn't have a gun and 30 seconds later without moving or anything suddenly has 2 more fully loaded guns and extra ammo little plot errors like this really ruined the movie for me if what you are looking for is a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything turns out okay then you'll probably love this movie personally it doesn't matter to me what kind of movie it is as long as it is realistic make me believe that the story is true this story was so obviously fictional in so many aspects that i came away feeling unsatisfied	negative
kingdom county vermont 1927 noel lord rip torn lives with his indian mate bangor tantoo cardinal in the area where a large dam is to be built noel however is not willing to give up on his land and he'll have to fight the dam company in order to prevent the county from any possible destruction where the rivers flow north is a gripping contemplative story powered by the memorable performances of rip torn recently seen in the small but juicy role of louis xv in sofia coppola's underrated marie antoinette and tantoo cardinal dances with wolves smoke signals director jay craven who also co wrote the script with don bredes based on howard frank mosher's novel and cinematographer paul ryan crafted this powerful story with unique contemplative pace visuals which remind me of terrence malick's and john huston's best moments it's an underrated independent period piece of the first electric half of the 90's usually regarded as the rise of quentin tarantino's burlesque pulp fiction is a masterpiece indeed but the man suffers from orson welles' syndrome todd solondz's disturbing suburbia danny boyle's dark vision of the uk let's not mention that beach flick with dicaprio though jay craven should be more regarded on the lists of great indie filmmakers as well he's been leading a respectful discreet career and it's always a pleasure to see a constant talent like his my vote 8 10	positive
i have not watched every jackass episode it was mildly entertaining if nothing else was going but after watching jackass 2 i was fond of bam and dunn they had a nice attitude in the movie jackass so i figured i'd tune in on viva la bam boy was i mistaken seriously you could pair a bunch of 2'graders provide them with the same budget and i bet they could knock off something more creative on the screen i mean c'mon mtv at 23 where most people are tuned in you give us this rubbish everything seems so forced you don't know the characters because there's no attitude at all you can't appreciate bam or dunn or anyone for that matter if there would just be a tiny tiny doze of thought anything we won't forget as soon as next shot goes on they finally manage to create a good shot and you like whats going on you sit there just waiting for their reaction and then some jerk closes the scenes with two lame sentences and bang was that the close for that shot or what please if i had been there i would freak out and laugh do some insane stuff and have my adrenaline pumping but these guys just scripted stupid reactions yes they get a few chuckles of the audience by cheap gross jokes or gigantic jokes which in my opinion are such a waste of cash many many normal humans which was not taken under the jackass wing could in a heartbeat write a far funnier script or impress with visual camera work even spontaneous wannabe cool guys without a script would pull of a better job mtv could in a whim bring more soothing material on the screen you just need to fire the writer of this stupid show some scenes actually require a bit of courage and therefore 2 stars	negative
i just finished watching the movie tonight and i truly loved it john denver didn't play a pastor but it was the reverend of the little town who decided to leave the floor for john denver to speak it's a really great movie with a wonderful christmas message it was also fun to watch	positive
soon after this movie was released salman khan was handed over a 6 year imprisonment read further to know why am i mentioning this and i heaved a sigh of relief not that i was happy that he got jail for something which because he was a celeb but i was happy cus this meant no more salman khan movies no more his histrionics and no more over hyped acting read overacting this movie made no sense whatsoever the scene where the kid belonging to one of the family makes a rocket which was voice activated according to the movie script it would chase anyone but ultimately it finds only salman khan bare chested well this is what happened the rocked gets activated in another foolish way and you have to have an iq of 001 to believe that then it chases salman khan who was on his water scooter and the chase continues unless he is done with all the possible stunts he could show to foolish audience in my regard all those people who have given this movie 5 and above unless they are paid to do that another of breath taking unbelievable scene was at the end when all the arrangements about the marriage is made and salman khan with govinda in disguise comes and stall the marriage by another of those highly unwanted songs later on even though everything is done and ready a mere confession of govinda and katrina kaif to katrina's father and bingo everything is fine and govinda marries kartina this made me wonder if convincing was so easy why did not they do that and tortured us for so many hours and wasted my money this movie is must avoid and don't even think it had any scene worth watching the plot is way too disconnected with characters popping from no where and ultimately vanishing for ex choota don what a waste of characters after this movie i took a pledge that i would not watch salman khan movies for the rest of my life unless it wins an oskar hahahah which means i would never watch	negative
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was it tells the story of custer played by errol flynn during and after his graduation from westpoint although i've heard that the film isn't very historically accurate hollywood never is i still enjoyed it as i knew little of the real events anyway i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic it brought me close to tears as he and ned sharp arthur kennedy rode to their deaths on little big horn i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child but it wasn't until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was i'll give this film 10 out of 10	positive
wow i suspected this one to be bad but now i find myself just at a loss for words honestly no words of mine can do this movie any justice i'll try to say something anyway this truly is one unique gem one of the worst kind lash la rue given his background as an actor doing a whip fight with a toltec sorcerer zombie during the movie's climax a true stroke of genius without a doubt it rarely happens that i laugh out loud when watching a movie alone it happened numerous times with this one the accents of the actors man the accents and the dialogues i heard them speak and the acting itself i just couldn't believe what i was hearing that fat uncle farting so loudly when walking up to the house together with his little nephew for no apparent reason whatsoever tits yes there's titties and female ass there's even a naked chick in a bathtub sipping a beer that one stretch his mouth over his face kill was the bomb a true highlight the comedy aspects were just totally bonkers i just couldn't believe what i was seeing and hearing for a while i even thought that they were unintentional shaking my head in disbelief but about halfway in the movie i started to get the bigger picture guess it took me half a movie to dumb down half of my brain to finally get it i had a really hard time believing this movie but it's good really i think it had one black chick walking up to a very tiny cupboard opening it and then saying wooow look at all the storage space and she said it like she meant it i mean that's good dialogue and good acting right oh and perhaps needless to say lash la rue's whip skills suck major ass in the dark power it's really sad and pathetic to behold that's all part of the comedy of course or wait i might be wrong no yes i'm wrong lash la rue was amazing with the whip it was the editor's fault he messed it up cutting his lashes together and all or wait it might have been the camera operator he filmed from the wrong angles then why didn't phil smoot say anything that's it it's the director's fault but it's a good movie i'm just gonna quit talking about it i have nothing meaningful to say anyway except for the fact that i hope my brain will recover from this experience some time soon	negative
set in the cameroons in west africa in the 1950s claire denis' chocolat is a beautifully photographed and emotionally resonant tone poem that depicts the effects of a dying colonialism on a young family during the last years of french rule the theme is similar to the recent nowhere in africa though the films are vastly different in scope and emphasis the film is told from the perspective of an adult returning to her childhood home in a foreign country france dalens mireille perrier a young woman traveling through cameroon recalls her childhood when her father francois cluzet was a government official in the french cameroons and she had a loving friendship with the brooding manservant protée isaach de bankolé the heart of the film however revolves around france's mother aimée giulia boschi and her love hate relationship with protée that is seething with unspoken sexual tension the household is divided into public and private spaces the white families rooms are private and off limits to all except protée who works in the house while the servants are forced to eat and shower outdoors exposing their naked bronze bodies to the white family's gazes it becomes clear when her husband marc françois cluzet goes away on business that aimée and protée are sexually attracted to each other but the rules of society prevent it from being openly acknowledged in one telling sequence she invites him into her bedroom to help her put on her dress and the two stare at each other's image in the mirror with a defiant longing in their eyes knowing that any interaction is taboo the young france cecile ducasse also forms a bond with the manservant feeding him from her plate while he shows her how to eat crushed ants and carries her on his shoulders in walks beneath the nocturnal sky in spite of their bond the true nature of their master servant relationship is apparent when france commands protée to interrupt his conversation with a teacher and immediately take her home and when protée stands beside her at the dinner table waiting for her next command when a plane loses its propeller and is forced to land in the nearby mountains the crew and passengers must move into the compound until a replacement part can be located each visitor shows their disdain for the africans one a wealthy owner of a coffee plantation brings leftover food from the kitchen to his black mistress hiding in his room another luc jean claude adelin an arrogant white frenchman upsets the racial balance when he uses the outside shower eats with the servants and taunts aimée about her attraction to protée leading her to a final emotional confrontation with the manservant chocolat is loosely autobiographical adapted from the childhood memories of the director and is slowly paced and as mysterious as the brooding isolation of the land on which it is filmed denis makes her point about the effects of colonialism without preaching or romanticizing the characters there are no victims or oppressors no simplistic good guys protée is a servant but he is also a protector as when he stands guard over the bed where aimée and her daughter sleep to protect them from a rampaging hyena it is a sad fact that protée is treated as a boy and not as a man but bankolé imbues his character with such dignity and stature that it lessens the pain because of its pace western audiences may have to work hard to fully appreciate the film and denis does not in roger ebert's phrase coach our emotions the truth of chocolat lies in the gestures and glances that touch the silent longing of our heart	positive
it could not have come from a different country nor from a different time this movie simply oozes psychedelia influenced late 60s italian cinema so pseudo serious and sexually free sumptuous settings and dreamy music make this a visual and aural delight plus we get the lovely dagmar lassander surely at her very best looking the kinky goings on make for a wild ride and if the romps amidst the mimosa towards the end seem overlong it is but another rather charming trait of the time you were probably expected to split those few minutes between the screen and your girlfriend and it does of course herald a twist in the proceedings it might have been better if philippe leroy didn't look quite so odd with his fraying red hair and twisted facial expression he does well though and has many silent moments where dagmar is cavorting and he has to show a mixture of love and hate not an ordinary narrative film by any means but for those who like that something different this is certainly that	positive

this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen if you know the real world and the people from those shows this movie will be top notch if you have never seen the real world you will still think it is an extremely funny movie but you won't get some of the inside jokes about the actors and the tv show	positive
a small town is attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty vampires the only hope is a lone avenger and a group of ragtag survivors released in 1993 darkness garnered something of a cult following upon release it's easy to see why it's loaded and i mean freaking loaded with gore and it's energy and enthusiasm like that found in other no budget cult horror flicks like the dead next door and the children of ravensback is actually rather infectious while that may be true that's sadly not enough to save it the film was shot on a super 8 so the image is grainy and dark making things very difficult to see it would have been great if it had obscured the protagonists dreadful mullet also grating is the soundtrack made up of annoying casio keyboard and even more annoying death metal seriously what is it with these no budget horror flicks and bad death metal while one isn't expecting oscar worthy performances the acting is still strictly amateur hour as the actors sometimes seem almost confused instead of frightened or threatened in the end i'm sure fans of no budget gorefests will love this everyone else though will wish there was a little more meat on the ribs	negative
dragon hunters has to be the best looking animated film i've ever seen it was jaw dropping the film is about a couple rogues in search for some cash their weird furry blue dog that pees fire and a girl who dreams about becoming a knight and they are sent on a quest to go to the ends of the earth to kill the world gobbler an impossibly immense dragon but honestly it doesn't even matter what the film is about because it is jaw droppingly gorgeous the gravity in this fantasy world is different so blocks of architecture and spheres of land float around amidst cathedrals and castles and villages alike and there are forests of floating lily pads the world is so creative so uniquely beautiful with a sort of muted storybook look to it the world looks like a set of gorgeous paintings the monsters are visually stunning as well like a fire dragon comprised of a swarm of evil red bats some of the plot isn't too original like the main protagonists wanting their farm a la of mice and men and never seem to be able to make it in the world but the gorgeous graphics some seriously sinister scenes and emotion evoking dialog makes this film spectacular	positive
this film entered production before ww2 began but was not released until it was well under way with significant fascist sympathy in the us and chaplin himself being suspected as a communist sympathiser the great dictator was a very courageous endeavour such risks in film making thinly veiled political statements would be almost inconceivable today imagine the fallout if someone were to make an equally satirical film today which criticised the usa's foreign policy this film is hilarious poignant and tragic the tragedy is that chaplin makes a plea for the madness to end but it is already to late for him and for us a must see if you have any interest whatsoever in history film making politics or sattire as an art form	positive
i sense out there a mix of confusion and varying degrees of personal taste in the reactions to this film yes there are vampire stereotypes yes there are scientific stereotypes covered here even martial arts stereotypes all well and good and sure not all perfectly done however i sense one crucial point about this film is being overlooked the cultural significance of its location the film is set in pensacola florida and does not try to avoid saying so that's a bold move in the film world today and a rare treat for fans of indy films and indeed it may not be the last pensacola is world renowned as a navy town an aviation town a lumber town and sometimes even as a hotbed for political controversy rarely is it seen as a growing film town but that's all changing now more film companies are coming in to shoot and more native pensacolians are discovering the power of cinema for themselves this film is part of a growing trend of pensacola based indy films and more are on the way pensacola is making a big noise in the global film community and by and by the world is taking more notice watch and listen world the pensacolians are coming like a virus	positive
i'm seldom partial to movies about smart assed teenagers who have problems with authority but toy soldiers has grown on me with repeated viewings this is as much a movie about billy tepper growing up and becoming an adult as anything else and i give credit to sean astin and writer director daniel petrie jr that they don't make a big deal of that but let it just unfold and sneak up on you the camaraderie of tepper's friends their grief over joey's death and their joy at their survival all are genuinely moving and i have to admit i take a certain patriotic and perhaps slightly reptilian glee when the u s army guys finally move in and righteously kick some narco terrorist butt ooh rah general kramer and the heroic robert folk score is the cherry on top i'm sure i could find a hundred reasons not to like toy soldiers but as long as we don't take it too seriously i don't see the need this is one of the most entertaining bad movies in my pantheon	positive
don't listen to the prissy critics who are probably bitter gamers still sore from the roasting silverman infamously gave them at spike tv video game awards a couple of months ago the sarah silverman is wonderfully bizarre surreal immature ridiculous and would fit rather nicely in a adult swim line up if silverman tones down the juvenile doody jokes and emphasizes the darker meaner undercurrent the show is so far just hinting at we could have one of the greatest cult comedies since the cancelled strangers with candy but just from watching the pilot its just solid not outstanding offbeat dark comedy musical but with huge potential silverman has created a hilarious child woman of a character a prettier younger jewish american princess version of the late great jerri blank and the show features one of the most unconventional non stereotypical portrayals of a gay couple i have ever seen on television early reviews are suggesting the next couple of episodes surpass the pilot so i can't wait to see how this show unfolds	positive
latter days is the best gay movie of the homosexual genre most of the films entail sappy stories one night stands and let us not forget infamous baseball teams latter days actually contains male affection beyond the kiss in the dark and quite graphic material that made me wonder whether the film belonged at blockbuster or badpuppy com the films emotional journey is what sets it above the rest in the genre not until this film had i seen a story of such intense passion and love and the torture that it can bring i think when people cry during movies they should be beaten but i found myself sobbing throughout several scenes because of the realistic nature of the world in which we live i suggest every gay male see this film and if you have a boyfriend thank him	positive
i have always loved bad creations rhetorical criticism and my film professor validated that for me in college this is not as bad as the star wars holiday special there is nothing bottom of the lunchbox than that mistake this the fantastic four film complete with the i have no idea why hes excessively tweaking his fingers doctor doom is high on the list of colossal mistakes doom's dialogue kill him let him go is classic as it is staggering in its hilarity the editing is good and the director of photography isn't half bad those are the up sides i cannot however subject all my friends to watch in its entirety but if i can get the chance i show them the can jonny and sue come to outer space with us scene i do i also include the final scene scene where redd richards in his ff outfit for some reason alongside his bride sue in her wedding dress get into the limo the payoff is the extendo arm in farewell as they drive away most people are in complete disbelief that something like this exists	negative
there is only one thing essential to thorough appreciation of the indian runner unzip your trousers peek inside is there evidence of a y chromosome okay you'll do this film has all the male requisites blood guns car chases fond women death multiple tattoos cigarettes liquor violence pyrotechnics what have i left out oh yeah blowtorches as a woman i seriously hope sean penn regards this as a when i was a child ' kind of effort since he both wrote and directed the thing he's nearly solely responsible an uneven cast viggo mortensen as usual demonstrating brilliantly how the job's supposed to be done tries to save penn too late the lines and action are there even devoted skilled acting can't change those i found this movie puerile and silly as well as predictable the dialogue staggers along sandy dennis has my respect for trying to breathe life into a woodenly maternal monologue without motherly authenticity then she dies after a bit so does the protagonists' father played by charles bronson their absence is hardly noticeable at intervals the pyrotechnics etc noted above appear to liven things up and scare the audience into thinking something significant is occurring if you're male and under 25 you may adore this film plan to return to it at 35 think you'll still like it i don't think so	negative
caught this on ifc yesterday and can't believe the positive reviews am i the only one who thought these ladies were anything but kate tells jed she could get fired because she's supposed to be a pillar of the community but puts out for him then they suddenly decide they're in love and she's so devastated over his death she doesn't go to his funeral much less tell his family the good news by the way how did an american get to be the headmistress of a very proper british school janine should have been kicked off the force for her inexcusable abuse of power but nothing happens and she winds up boffing a con she brought in for questioning and the less said about molly the better as for the guilt janine and molly feel over jed please it's the punk's own damn fault he got turned into roadkill where's the guilt over poor gerald who gets puked on if only i could do the same to the bozos behind this movie	negative
second part actually episode 4 8 of the hit danish tv series is slightly inferior to the first one but has plenty of laughs and scares as well this time udo kier plays two parts as the monster baby and his demon like father other standout parts this time are søren pilmark s doctor krogshoj who must face the horrible revenge of dr helmer and once again patient mrs drusse tries to solve the mysteries miss marple style ends on a cliffhanger and following the deaths of lead actors ernst hugo järegård dr helmer and kirsten rolffes mrs drusse you wonder how they re ever going to be able making part iii but i hope von trier will give it a shot sadly morten rotne leffers the down s syndrome dishwasher 2 died shortly after as well look for stellan skarsgård in a cameo	positive
i'm just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of monsieur ozon i've seen only 4 films so far and with the last one in the row it hit me that all of them were in fact about lonely women and their actions not a single non lonely female character out of 12 and all of them bring heavy impact of surroundings this film is probably the only one out of four where this impact is for good the gay theme is an almost standard part of background for ozon's films so it doesn't grab the accent although the looks of the characters might watch for the feelings not for their objects very nice and fleeting truly like a summer romance and while being a relaxation to thought and mind it gives some food for the soul	positive
there are spoilers but trust me i'm doing you a favor my friends and i like to watch crappy movies every so often inspired by mystery science theater and our knack for on the spot jokes we set out to find movies worth watching that are in fact not worth watching however trouble comes into paradise when these movies can only be found if you buy them and i am a firm believer in not giving one cent to such a group of talentless scumbags so as another reviewer has said films like this are a reason why downloading movies for free should be legalized i prefer the idea of instead of straight to video you have straight to internet that way the ass bags who made this travesty won't ever turn a profit which unfortunately you know they do they hire a bunch of actors who can't act special effects from a high school classroom rubber snakes you can get at the dollar store constant vomiting of green jell o and the two main characters who seem to switch between being border jumping mexicans who only speak spanish to arabs to being 100 fluent in english random nudity a guy being shot like 10 times including one to the side of the head and living and the most retarded ending in the history of film book cave drawings and hustler magazine the fact that i actually predicted that the jell o puking snake girl would actually transform into a snake about half way through terrifies me anyways the movie is great to make fun of but you have to make sure there's at least 4 of you and you're all spitting out jokes in rapid fire because if there's even 1 second of watching this movie where you're not laughing your ass off you will feel physically ill i kid you not my friends and i were eating chicken wings and now i can't even look at such a thing anymore without being reminded of this piece of sh t this film is one above alien vs hunter which is by far the second worst movie ever made and i've seen lots of bad movies incidentally it's the same production company as this film and that bald guy is in both as well just thought you might like to know that little fun fact 100 out 0f 10	negative
last evening i had the remarkable pleasure of seeing the movie hitch i was stunned and amazed will smith did a phenomenal job in a role that he isn't always associated with he proved once and for all that he does not need to be holding a gun to be a great actor in a movie kevin james was also very impressive i admit that i've always like him on the king of queens but this role really brought him into the light more and i hope to see him on the big screen a lot more in the near future the movie was funny and adorable and i recommend it to any guy as the best date movie you could ever imagine the mix of comedy romance and drama left me feeling complete it's nothing like most chick flicks in the sense of tears and sadness but holds its own and i think can be equally enjoyed by males as well as females i encourage all couples especially to see this movie but even if you aren't involved with someone you may pick up some great ideas from hitch two way big thumbs up	positive
haven't seen the film since first released but it was memorable performances by rip torn and conchata farrell were superb photography excellent moving story line and everything else about it was of the highest standard yet it seems to have been pretty much forgotten maybe because uk is an odd market for it but i haven't seen the film on tv or video which is sad has it had more success in us where it might rightly be seen as a quite accurate historical drama always reckon that 50 of a good film is the music and though i'm not certain i think the title theme was a simple but moving clarinet solo of what a friend we have in jesus the film then went on to disprove that am i right or wrong	positive
heartland was in production about the same time as michael cimino's heaven's gate heartland cost a fraction to make but is 10 times the piece of film heaven's gate was the biggest and most expensive 40 mil in 1980 hollywood flops of all time its failure resulted in the sale of the united artists studio to mgm imdb entry heartland cost a few hundred thousand dollars and benefits from great writing direction photography and acting it easily draws you into the beauty joys hardships and sorrow of pioneer life it's sad that hollywood sometimes would pour millions into turkeys based on a director's single big hit and neglect such a wonderful story	positive
i see a lot of really negative posts by people who wrote in august though the movie was not released in the us at least until the middle of september maybe these are unhappy expats living in s korea who saw it early i am in the us and just saw it today i thought the special effects were excellent better than the trailer the story was non western but i think we are all used to this from many other movies it wasn't at all hard to follow the acting by the leads was weak but other people were quite good there was humor throughout too i rated it at 8 because i had a good time watching it which is what i went for	positive
miike makes a children's adventure film not unlike the neverending story it's actually one of my least favorite of the director's films even the worst miike is better than a good many films though and the great yokai war has a lot in it that's worth recommending it's at least as loud and obnoxious as most american kiddie flicks i might think kids themselves would find a lot to like in it the dvd includes an english dub but like all of miike's films it can tend to move very slowly that means you've got kind of a weird unevenness where sometimes there's a loud action sequence and the next scene will drag on forever as characters converse the story itself isn't very good either and miike's perpetual flaw of incoherency rears its ugly head most of what i liked came from the technical side of things this has to be miike's most expensive movie and it looks fantastic yokai are japanese spirits and they come in all different fantastical forms and the costume designers special effects crew and everyone else involved in the designs just did an outstanding job i've seen the 1968 film this one is supposedly based on yokai monsters spook warfare and the cheesy rubber suit monsters you can find there have been transformed into more believable entities using state of the art makeup and special effects i especially liked the look of one of the bad guys or girls in this case agi who sports dark eye shadow a tight white outfit a white beehive hairdo and a whip she's played incidentally by chiaki kuriyama whom you might remember as lucy liu's teenage henchgirl in kill bill vol 1 the hero of the film is played by ryunosuke kamiki who provided voices for miyazaki's spirited away and howl's moving castle	positive
this documentary is a proof of talent being used for mean purposes the fact that it is financed by the venezuelan government gives it a lack of legitimacy in the purpose of searching for the truth of what really happened those horrible days of april 2002 in venezuela something even we venezuelans don't know for sure there are ways of lying and the directors of this stuff lie both by omission and by knowledge the venezuelan political process is too complex to be easily understood by foreign audiences and they take advantage of that for instance possible spoilers they show pro chávez demonstrators shooting at an empty street what the hell they did that for in a way of saying they didn't kill anyone but didn't bother showing the images we all saw here of opposition demonstrators and a journalist falling dead or injured at the other side of that empty street they can't explain why the chopper of the political police was the only one authorised to fly over caracas that day and did nothing against the snipers that were all over the roofs of the buildings nearby the presidential palace something that would exhibit how inefficient would be the security measures to guard the president a few days after the coup the chief of the military guard in charge was asked at the national assembly our congress why didn't they act against the snipers and he said 'cause they weren't there to act against the president isn't that a confession there is so much more the fact that the highest rank military announced that chávez had resigned and 2 days later he said he had lied because that's politics and nowadays is the minister of internal affairs of chávez' administration it would take me thousands of words to explain all the lies depicted in this documentary made with the intention of selling the world an image of the good old hugo chávez who rules for the poor and the bad rich opposition that wants him out at all costs when the truth is that 60 70 of people rejects his government and that percentage includes the poor i hope those of you who have seen and bought this will be able to see a different version that is being made by a group of venezuelan people showing no less than 30 lies nazi propaganda has returned	negative
altman and scorsese have twisted sex together in one of the greatest american films of the past 20 years boogie nights didn't make a huge initial splash and i still don't think it's received the credit it deserves the immediate clamor surrounding the film some porn movie with marky mark was wholly without merit what paul thomas anderson has created is no less than a stunning representation of the pursuit and subsequent loss of the american dream if such a thing still exists for those of you who have been living in a box or a confessional for the past 8 years boogie nights tells the literal rise and fall tale of young eddie adams wahlberg eddie is just a dopey kid from torrance california who wants something more out of life his room is soaked in muscle bound naive americana his dreams are far bigger than his potential but not quite as large as his special gift his bald headed southern gent quickly raises the attention and eyebrows of the booming omni present adult film industry jack horner burt reynolds as the film's twinkle eyed papa bear gets wind of eddie's hidden talent and decides to put him in a movie before you can say deep throat eddie has changed his name to dirk diggler and exposed his massive member to a wide eyed public fame and fortune make dirk's acquaintance as do a bevy of local porn celebs his friends and co workers become his makeshift family but it soon proves to be a sunday picnic like no other as the feel good 70s give way to the coke addled video friendly 80s dirk co begin a dangerous backslide anderson put everything he had into this glorious moving epic it sizzles and never fizzles nary a frame of this monumental picture is wasted and the characters and their dialogue live with us long after elo fades from the soundtrack see this one immediately and then watch it again and again	positive
it's become extremely difficult to find a good horror movie anymore thought this movie was a good thriller could have had better production values but what kept me going was the suspense and the twists i had real reservations before seeing this movie because of the cover i was afraid that it would be excessively bloody and gory i was wrong although there is a lot of scary parts there is a lot of suspense and drama too the acting in dead line was better than what you would expect from a micro budget horror flick the characters were believable the movie is really thrilling and quite scary at moments so it makes you grab your seat until the ending credits roll because of its production values the sound is not very good for example 8 10	positive
this isn't another searing look at the holocaust but rather an intimate story about the events that took place on a small street in berlin and some of the people that were involved this film starts in the present time in new york city where ruth weinstein jutta lampe is in mourning over the death of her husband and family members have all gathered to her side ruth's daughter hannah maria schrader slowly learns that her mother was raised by an aryan woman named lena fischer doris schade and so she travels to germany and locates the 90 year old who tells her about the events on rosenstrasse spoiler alert lena talks about berlin in 1943 where the gestapo would hold all the jewish spouses in a building on rosenstrasse street even though they are supposed to have immunity for being married to aryans and for nine days a group of women would wait outside and shout for their release eight year old ruth svea lohde awaits for her mother to come out and has nowhere to go but she meets 33 year old lena katja riemann who takes her in lena's husband fabian martin feifel is also inside and eventually she tries to socialize with nazi officers to get them to do something this film is directed by margarethe von trotta who is making her first feature film in almost 10 years after working in television and while this is clearly not one of her more provocative efforts she remains one of the most revered directors in europe this is not one of those nazi films where we view horrible acts of inhumanity to jews although we do see some severe treatment being issued out but instead this is more of a retelling of a small event that meant life and death to the people involved this film isn't trying to shock anyone or open the door to debates on the circumstances but what it simply wants to do is just shed a light on a small but true life event that occurred during an historical period part of the films strength comes from its actors and there are some good performances that shine through especially by riemann and young lohde and it's always good to see schrader aimee jaguar in a pivotal role this isn't a great film or something that's going to change your perspective on wwii but considering that innocent lives were put to death because of the events that took place i think that reason alone is important enough to retell this true story	positive
a light hearted comedy nothing shows us a world that we sometimes wish to escape to a world of nothing anything you don't like be it a stack of bills a bad memory or even hunger can disappear at your wish they approached this movie very well and with an enjoyable starring duo there were only a few things i didn't like about nothing and they weren't even part of the main movie first the post credits scene and yes there is one good for a chuckle but what were they trying to accomplish with that i was confused and eager to see a return to something after a whole movie of nothing instead we just hear a random assortment of noises and they scream it tries to set up a sequel in my opinion and wasn't really necessary nor was it funny after the turtle crawled out of frame second the trailer i saw the trailer on the dvd and like others have already said this it promotes a horror movie that never came oh well poor marketing i guess if you see this at your movie rental store take a look because nothing is a great movie to watch if you have a big screen though you might want to wear shades	positive
the most striking feature about this well acted film is the almost surreal images of the era and time it was shot it i could sense the time and moments were stark and very real even the language was so well chosen it's all too often when colloquialisms of today's world are carelessly used in movies about another time and place	positive
sadly the print of the film we were going to watch burned in the fire at universal studios last week so we were stuck with video that could even be a metaphor for this second rate king kong movie from toho studios' stalwart director ishiro honda essentially it's a warm up for king kong versus godzilla it even uses the idea of a mecha kong like mecha godzilla of course the movie climaxes with king kong fighting mecha kong on top of the expo tower in tokyo but if you didn't know that already then maybe you're in the age group that this movie was intended for the cast is headed by a guy named rhodes reason who we had never heard of glancing over his list i see mostly a lot of scattered american tv credits so it's interesting that they dragged him all the way to japan so that they could have a nominal american hero the real hero of the movie is the more sensitive japanese commander played by akira takarada who i recognized from hiroshi inagaki's iconic version of chushingura 47 ronin and also from the original godzilla films by honda i'm sorry rhodes reason whoever you are but this guy has way more screen presence and you can bet that everyone wants him to end up with the cute little blonde played by linda miller we laughed at the way reason would always find a way to interject himself between miller and takarada who it seemed like she kind of preferred of course like all kong leading ladies her primary relationship is with the king himself she discovers a nice trick if you talk to a giant ape really really slowly he'll understand what you're saying and if you're a blonde gal that means that he'll do whatever you tell him to do that fact is not lost on dr who eisei amamoto and madame piranha mie hama representing a nation which shall not be named who plan on using her as bait to get kong to dig up mineral deposits that are trapped at the north pole yes this is truly the plot of the whole movie apparently only a giant ape is going to be capable of digging out these minerals which can be used to make super powerful weapons dr who builds mecha kong to get it but the circuitry gets in the way so they decide to go for the real kong kong himself seems momentarily infatuated with mecha kong a story element that might have made the film more interesting but wasn't followed up on by the end of the movie the cute blonde has shouted kong or king kong in her chirpy voice so many times that when the two heroes tell her to let him go at the end they're speaking for all of us basically this movie squanders whatever majesty was possible in the kong character by making him a heroic and friendly figure much too early just like the newest version of the story kong is just a guy in a suit in this movie and they show quite a lot of him to the point where the goofy face becomes impossible to take seriously it's a nice looking movie i'm sure it satisfies the demands or desires of fans of this type of thing which is really more of a wrestling film than a monster film in a lot of ways the monsters don't ever really scare in these films they just jump around and push each other around a lot it's not a worthless movie but it's extremely predictable and formulaic so for anyone under the age of 10 or so it probably will only be entertaining as comedy	negative
this film differentiates itself from the run of the mill wonder of the human body documentaries by bravely if bizarrely opting to elicit disgust in the viewer in one scene the camera closes in on a gigantic 50 foot zit as a teenager squeezes pus and fluid out of it in another the camera is semisubmerged in a swamp of half digested food and stomach acid as parts of a pasta salad drop in from the esophagus and plop into the goo in a final tour de force the camera takes the viewer on a harrowing ride through a forest of teenage armpit hair unfortunately i'm not making any of this up see this film if you must but bring your vomit bag and don't have pasta salad beforehand	negative
i find it difficult to comprehend what makes viewer's feel this is a powerful movie i would guess that the main intention of this film would be a character study and the effects of racism in a british community it is therefore all the more disappointing that all the characters are two dimensional and the acting is at the level of a college performing arts course i'm always sceptical of improvisation another word for being too lazy to write a decent script i was embarrassed by the performances and sat in an audience who laughed when they surely were supposed to be moved by the story racism is a serious issue but i think a subtle approach in cinema works far better than laying it on with trowel	negative
i've seen lonesome dove dead man's walk and the streets of laredo and now the return to lonesome dove if you are hungry for more after watching lonesome dove this'll fill yer belly great cast great story most definitely a close second to lonesome dove i will be purchasing this movie to add to my collection this is the best or at least my favorite performance by jon voight he is captain call lou gossett jr playing isom pickett is not somebody i'd mess with he is a bad ass with perspective william peterson does a great job as well rick schroder is back as newt with an angst filled performance that reminds me of his stint on nypd blue my only problem with this film and it's really picking nits is that i had the impression that call wanted to be the first man to graze cattle in montana and it's obvious that dunnigan had already been there a while a little inconsistent but easily overlooked as you lose yourself in the fantastic tale i especially love the apparent character growth of jasper fant and july johnson i've watched this movie several times and am ready for another sequel	positive
this is a kind of movie that will stay with you for a long time soha ali and abhay deol both look very beautiful soha reminds you so much of her mother sharmila tagore abhay is a born actor and will rise a lot in the coming future the ending of the movie is very different from most movies in a way you are left unsatisfied but if you really think about it in real terms you realize that the only sensible ending was the ending shown in the movie otherwise it would have been gross injustice to everyone the movie is about a professional witness who comes across a girl waiting to get married in court her boyfriend does not show up and she ends up being helped by the witness slowly slowly over the time he falls in love for her it is not clear if she has similar feelings for him or not watch the movie for complete details the movie really belongs to abhay i look forward to seeing more movies from him soha is pretty but did not speak much in the movie her eyes her innocence did most of the talking	positive
flipping through the channels i was lucky enough to stumble upon the beginning of this movie i must admit that it grabbed my attention almost immediately i love older films and this is or should be considered a classic one of the most wonderful rarities of this movie is that the main character was not only female but she was also a bad girl i highly recommend this movie	positive
i'm a big mark for the music of neil young and with that and the glowing praise the film received in many alt indie press circles hit the first showing of greendale i could find my excitement was short lived as this turgid storyline and weak lyrical momentum left most filmgoers either asleep or disappointed neil says the film started as a soundtrack and the characters came to life so much that they just filmed the soundtrack not the best way to craft a story no character really has an arc and when significant events do happen the viewer doesn't cared because film technique annoyance levels are so high by that point the film is all song and to that end the characters on end mouth the lyrics as they're sung the technique works for the first stanza it is done and is grating on the nerves after that it doesn't feel real or fake it just feels unwelcome terrible acting with characters finding one mood and playing all of it poor lighting at times the only kudos i can give the film are in regard to several scenes shot as newscast but the technique is so used in cinema today that this film did little to further it an alright soundtrack but nothing i'm quick to buy a bad film	negative
an excellent cast who do their best with an awful script inept direction and some of the worst score that i have ever heard more tv movie of the week than serious drama which is sad when one considers that the source material is very serious and very real the film makers decided that instead of building drama and character it was better to just show the most graphic and violent bits and hope that the audience would be shocked into sympathy and caring in my opinion one the most blatant forms of cut and paste film adapting	negative
excellent plot within a plot within a plot shame about two of my film heroes having a good snog must be my upbringing very well acted by all you never quite know who's going to out do who the last little twist at the end allows for all to get their just deserts recommend to all a harmless tongue in cheek thriller which if it has any faults is probably michael caine's over use of the word bloody but that's his signature isn't it 9 10	positive
i really enjoyed this movie i am a single dad with a 17 year old daughter who is smart athletic and talented i wish my girl applied herself so well to solving crimes and helping others so for me perhaps this is pg level fantasyland i read many nancy drew books in my teen years long long ago sure this character was ably played by emma roberts but did not resemble the nancy drew i recall from the books that is due to script not the acting emma is an adorable teen playing a self confident industrious and proud character with good manners and good taste she is not caught up in the trendy competitiveness around her there are some weaknesses in the plot aside from not resembling the nancy drew of the books and trying to figure out what decade we're in like what is that car anyway i read the imdb overview before seeing the film as i was researching rachael leigh cook from other movies this is not one of her best roles but i will continue looking for more of her films rachael was too old to play this lead but does a fine job as the grown up orphan central to the mystery i am very disappointed in other reviews written here some expect perfect connection with the books some expect more credible situations or adult action film i got what i expected good entertainment well targeted to young teen girls and their fathers who want good kids with high standards of conduct and achievement this is a teen pg movie not james bond which would you want for a role model for your teenaged daughter	positive
artisticly shot actors portray exactly their role you get a real feeling watching lucienne ascend from poverty to the most beautiful girl around a sense of tragedy to triumph to tragedy again all in all i have seen this film at least 10 times and can very well say that prix de beute' the beauty prize miss europe is a major favorite in my silent film collection the expressiveness of louise brooks is perfect and i recommend this film to anyone who appreciates artistic beauty coupled with a tragic story line	positive
the french babbette appears at the modest house of two danish sisters wet cold and alone fleeing revolution in paris she seeks refuge in an obscure religious community on the windswept jutland coast unbeknownst to those who so generously take her in she is a great chef an artist of food babette gives herself to her adopted community through thrift productivity and shared faith she leaves only when she wins the french lottery 10 000 francs she returns laden with exotic cargo the makings of a single meal commemorating the birthday of the sister's father the community's founder this meal looms darkly in the minds of the pleasure denying faithful but its subtleties are translated by an aging military officer who as a young man in paris learned to appreciate the sensory experience unfolding here the meal is the film's climax a communion of love in the transitory artistry of food unaffectedly uplifting about art love and the meaning of life	positive
methinks the best screen version of quo vadis ever made well yeah the plot is not so strong and evident as in the book sometimes meandering and loosing its suspense among aesthetic subtleties but the film is really and beautifully strange has an enigma and style that other versions with r taylor and the new one from poland definitely lack it has the air of roman decadence the beauty of declining paganism and infant christianity at least i believe it has brandauer forrest and syudov did excellent job in portraying their characters forrest's petronius seems to be the biggest success of the cast let alone brandauer who is the one of the greatest actors ever and accumulates the very essence of this dying world imho that's it that is the way it happened guys imho	positive
there is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not related to one of the stars or a producer actress nichole hiltz she is the show in this slow moving and wildly unlikely story of revenge directed by simon gornick the film stars joyce hyser as a betrayed wife who decides to seek revenge on her cheatin' spouse oh but not by conventional means she plans a total guerrilla war and recruits bad girl nichole hiltz as her weapon of choice she wants nichole as tuesday to get close to her ex the handsome but dull stephan jenkins who should stick to music to embarrass him and ruin his life david deluise is good in his few brief moments and former crime story star anthony dennison is given virtually nothing to do but scowl hiltz on the other hand comes off at various times as sexy and playful then evil and devious she also handles vulnerable and maybe a bit psychotic well she's also quite hot though there's no naughty bits show so you can understand how she might be able to get to any guy she is aimed at but the performance is kind of wasted in this movie which is just not edgy or interesting enough to recommend	negative
spoilers ahead for the first ten minutes or so of star witness we're introduced to a quote typical urban american family unquote in a nameless city which is another way of saying warner brothers' version of nyc except for the young children including the charming dickie moore and sprightly sally blane they're a pretty dreary lot and their dinner table conversation is tedious and we wish the story would move along and bring in the star walter huston but wait folks wait all of a sudden serious gangster movie action breaks out drawing the family in against their will and after that this baby never lets up there's suspense an oscar nominated script good acting everything you want old movies to be it is here i do question chic sales performance he must be an acquired taste but his presence turns out to be crucial to the plot he's treated to special status in the credits so warner bros must have really been high on sale but how his corny old man routine fit in with the public then is something lost to me perhaps it is lost to time period an unknowable factor you had to be a 1931 moviegoer to understand also the climax is typically melodramatic nevertheless this right now is the best release of the studio that year i have seen so far however i've only seen eight so perhaps that's an inconclusive view do not miss this when tcm shows it 8 out of 10	positive
i stumbled on to this site while looking for a video or dvd of the 1959 version porgy and bess with sammy davis as sportin' life if anyone finds this on a home movie format please let me know i talk to my daughters all the time about things that they think are new which actually have already been done we went to see a live theater of version a couple of years ago and all i could talk about was this film sadly my daughters cannot remember seeing sammy davis jr in any production although they have heard of him needless to say they're not familiar with the other great actors in the film it is a major oversight not to have this classic film because of the cast on a home movie format for collectors and for future generations anyway in my opinion this version was the best	positive
brilliant aussie movie a little slow at the beginning but once it gets going you can't stop laughing when i originally saw the movie i vaguely knew the plot line as i am not sure if many people are aware that this movie is based on a true story and more so in particular the director and his mother obviously names have been changed i only knew this fact as the director is a friend of a friend of my family when i saw the movie somehow my stepmum kept it secret that we were to meet matthew newton after the screening such a nice gentleman except for a particularly nasty incident with his ex brillian casting as well with sam neill and others a great reason to keep supporting the australian film industry	positive
esther kahn is a young jewish woman living in an overcrowded jewish ghetto in 19th century england she is surrounded by looming oppressive dreary featureless worn brick architecture narrow sidewalks and streets blacked out windows and hordes of black and brown jacketed crowds she lives in a tiny apartment with her large family whom operate a clothes shop within the apartment as child she worked had no privacy wore colourless clothing shared a bed and remained silent to avert the mockery of her mother and siblings who ridiculed her for mimicking them out of boredom as a young woman her life remains the same she has no privacy lives in a state of mental and physical hebetude and lethargy and inertia exudes a blank featureless expression is clothed in plain unremarkable clothing and is continuously oppressed and dwarfed by the grey mundane massively imposing buildings and narrow streets and narrow hallways and narrow doorways and her loud mouthed mother and siblings and the prosaic banal lifestyle of her family her only form of mental escape is the yiddish theatre sitting in the balcony front row leaning over the rail there is a vast space between her mind and the stage a space that enables her to breathe think feel and yearn yet despite the freedom of thought the open stage provides for esther her face and body remain torpidly somnolent impassive dispassionate the plain and common looking summer phoenix brilliantly conveys esther's emotionless demeanour summer esther does not convey any desire to want anything or anticipate anything after an unusual explosive confrontation with her mother esther finally decides to break free from the bleak life she is trapped in she is eventually cast in minor parts in a few stage plays and meets nathan quellen portrayed by quintessential british actor ian holm who commences to teach esther the technical skill of acting from this point forward esther begins a grueling dual journey of learning how to act and learning how to feel she begins experiencing emotions she never felt before and she begins gaining the experience she needs to fully comprehend and wield the technical aspects of acting nathan walks her across the stage through the physical and emotional steps of surprise hesitancy anger disgust self loathing etc she then begins walking through those emotions in her personal life there are three truths nathan tells her the truth of how a character reacts the truth of how the actor would react and the truth that a character and actor are not the same person these technical steps and three truths slowly deconstruct esther's defenses and lead her to two edifying experiences in the denouement of the film which mark the beginning of her freedom of thought movement and emotion esther kahn is a technically challenging film to watch because of its odd and narrow camera shots lackluster photo direction which conveys the realistic lackluster setting of the ghetto and summer phoenix's characterless and insipid and unappealing portrayal which brilliantly conveys kahn's mental and physical hebetude and lethargy and lackluster nature a must see film for people who want to learn the technical craft of acting and for people who appreciate minimalistic films and character studies	positive
hilarious clean light hearted and quote worthy what else can you ask for in a film this is my all time number one favorite movie ever since i was a little girl i've dreamed of owning a blue van with flames and an observation bubble the cliché characters in ridiculous situations are what make this film such great fun the wonderful comedic chemistry between stephen furst harold and andy tennant melio make up most of my favorite parts of the movie and who didn't love the hopeless awkwardness of flynch don't forget the airport antics of leon's cronies dressed up as hari krishnas dancing chanting and playing the tambourine unbeatable the clues are genius the locations are classic and the plot is timeless a word to the wise if you didn't watch this film when you were little it probably won't win a place in your heart today but nevertheless give it a chance you may find that it doesn't matter what you say it doesn't matter what you do you've gotta play	positive
i seem to notice that a lot of people have never seen this movie and those that have usually dismiss it as garbage that's pretty bad really the first time i saw this movie i admittedly was almost one of those people thank god i'm patient otherwise i would have never found such a classic as goofy as this movie is it's also a must have for anyone who is either a fan of 80's movies or just happens to have a sense of humor i know that there are a lot of people out there that will tell you that this movie is sort of derivative of better off dead so what if it is they were both excellent movies i can honestly say that savage steve holland is a genius 10 10	positive
this movie just was not very funny there's not much else to say other than that it was kind of embarrassing for laurence fishburne and david hyde pierce both of whom deserve much better than this also i don't understand why after this movie completely and utterly bombed wb insisted on making it into a tv show	negative
this is by far the best movie i've seen in a long while it is a wholly original and beautiful plot it is not boring nor is it too dramatic the characters are tangible and realistic but it does not take away from the story line the fact that is not in english is most likely the final touch the end leaves you fulfilled in a way i've never experienced in a movie before i wish i had found this movie earlier more lines more lines more lines a lot more lines c'mon i'm done	positive
first of all season 1 is intolerably bad the prison is ridiculously unrealistic the characters are so two dimensional they're nearly transparent and the direction is terrible it runs like a bad video of a junior high school play characters wandering past the camera and uttering highly timed and rehearsed lines passing off as random prison talk soon the show gets better but not by much the return from the commercial break is always accompanied by some ridiculous monologue by wheelchair bound augustus hill who is played impressively by harold perrineau the only time his character is consistently bad is during the bad performance art monologues most of which take place in an inexplicable rotating glass cube and generally have nothing to do with what's taking place in the show unfortunately the bad ideas in oz could fill an encyclopedia of several volumes consider the whole situation first of all prisoners are able to hang out in plain sight getting drunk doing drugs and they not only have cd players cds they might as well pass out steak knives but all incoming mail is thoroughly examined by prisoners christ the place is like a men's club with guards guards that don't do much near the end of season two an older prisoner's grandson is diagnosed with leukemia and all of the prisoners pitch in thick wads of 20 and 50 bills to help send him to disneyworld to fulfill his dying wish these have to be the richest prisoners in the world every single prisoner in oz all of a sudden became caring loving guys except kenny wangler an irritating character but one of the only ones who is consistently convincing even adibisi wanted to be nice but that's okay because there is no order or sense in the show so even this is not much of a distraction later shockingly there is a boxing scene in which one inmate is wearing an i love cops t shirt in prison can you imagine i have a cousin who was in prison a few years ago i sent him an old picture of us with some friends in high school and in the picture one of my friends was holding an i love cops bumper sticker and one of the woods guys who have been in prison for years and years saw the picture but just grabbed it and ripped it to shreds my cousin got lucky kenny wangler also constantly berates the guards and even more senior officers for not calling him bricks one of them even tried to bribe him to go to an english class you may lose track of who is in charge the prisoners or the guards more than one investigator for example goes into the prison undercover and gets killed trying to stop the drug trade personally i would just stop letting prisoners inspect incoming mail rather than risk the lives of investigators let's see what else shillinger's son od's in solitary and no one thinks to ask the guard how he got the drugs he just got them i guess and make sure to pay attention otherwise you'll miss the reason why the prisoners have enough money to be able to afford ascellular dermal grafts when they get bad gums i didn't know guests in maximum security prisons were afforded such luxurious treatment options how about this when robson asks about dr faraj's schedule so he can ask what race of gums he was given faraj is so terrified that he goes to the warden and quits his job on the spot do doctors and dentists not have the right to request not to see certain prisoners after poet and o'reilly make the announcement to the entire prison robson asks to see dr faraj and is escorted to his office brought in without knocking and the guard promptly leaves without a word they might as well give him a gun i shouldn't go on about stupid ideas in this show but it's like a flood i can't stop it who thought of the chinese refugees who can't speak chinese and who disappear en masse from sight unless they're needed who thought of the goofy religious wars and all the reverend prisoners who though of robson's gum transplant what's the deal with busmalis and agamemnon agamemnon because he clearly doesn't belong in prison and busmalis because of the whole thing with his grandson macbeth because it was nothing but a ridiculous means to an end as it were but what are the worst ideas things that go nowhere which are constant an irish man comes to the prison and builds a bomb he threatens to blow up the entire prison the bomb turns out to be a dud and the episode ends with him being led away by the bomb squad after the entire prison is evacuated nothing is ever heard from him or about the whole situation again it's like it never happened in one episode prisoners are given dogs to train what the hell if that wasn't bad enough during one training session a guard fires his gun inside the prison walls as a training exercise no one seems to mind i also like how anytime some kind of altercation breaks out the culprits are pulled aside they don't say anything and the guards or warden or sister pete or whoever always says i hope you don't think i'm gonna let this go and then they walk away and let it go the audience won't remember maybe i'm spoiled by prison break but oz is just a goofy prison drama that might be better as a play a short one at least a low budget movie there is just not enough here to sustain a multi season tv show then again i watched six seasons of it on dvd sometimes i don't understand myself	negative
recently was traveling in norway from bergen norway and stopped in the small town of voss norway and there was a monument in honor of knute rockne who was born in voss years ago the people all know about knute to this day and tour guides are proud to stop at his monument this film is a great history of this great man and his great love for notre dame never realized that knute has such great talents in chemistry and laboratory science and also taught chemistry for years and at the same time coached the football team ronald reagan played the role of george gipp the gipper who was an outstanding football player reagan had a short role but gave a great supporting role in this film donald crisp father john callahan was outstanding as a priest who always had great faith in knute during his entire life at notre dame this is a great classic film and will be viewed by many generations to come enjoy	positive

i was struck by the awful acting and script for this movie all the characters seem rendered immobile by personal issues rather like deer in headlights they dither around whining and moaning about their emotions when decisive actions need to be taken i found myself yelling at the tv screen trying to wake them up to their situation and do something the plot line is implausible every time there is a key decision to be taken by a lead character one of the other characters has to bring up all the problems with the obvious decision as though to further render the decision more difficult it is a tried melodramatic ploy and just wants to make you groan clearly the import of the decision is obvious you don't need to treat the audience as idiots overall there is just too much emotional melodrama in the whole movie	negative
before seeing the sneak preview today of angels demons i cleared my mind of any uncertainties that might hold me back from enjoying it the enormous amount of hatred towards dan brown the fact that it was written by dan brown and because dan brown's name is slapped on all of the posters i went in with an open mind and expected the worse but instead what i got was a 2 and a half hour roman cat and mouse game with forrest gump and that is by all means good entertainment value the movie hangs loosely on the actual novel itself harvard symbologist robert langdon hanks jets off to rome after the pope's sudden death and the re election through papal conclave arranging all of this is the carmelengo patrick mckenna mcgregor however he soon learns of a new threat one that involves a secret brotherhood making its presence known an anti matter time bomb that vatican city is now targeted with and the kidnapping of four cardinals langdon using his intellects and trust me you'll be hearing a lot from it is given the task of finding and rescuing them using the mysterious path of illumination aiding him on the quest is cern scientist vittoria vetra zurer who is also the co creator of the anti matter the movie itself runs at an uneven pace one minute langdon and the swiss guard are speeding to save a branded cardinal the next minute he bores you with pointless information about every random object he passes evidently slowing the book's much anticipated action thriller sequences down it makes for an interesting read on paper but on screen it can go either way the character's are decently written onto the big screen ewan mcgregor does a convincing performance as the quiet but knowledgeable patrick mckenna famous accent included tom hanks is slightly more agile intellectually and physically since his last performance in the mediocre da vinci code stellen skarsgard plays commander richter the straight faced leader of the swiss guard unfortunately neither his nor ayelet zurer's performance are worthwhile ones and instead of playing a part in the story they are just kicked aside as assets however angels demons accomplishes what dvc could never a thrilling fast paced movie filled with satisfying explosions beautiful recreations of st peter's square and basilica including many of the churches and a pulsing bomb counting down the midnight hour ron howard does a decent job at directing this second langdon adventure this time taking in much criticism and almost completely exchanging the boring dialogue for tense chases almost while newcomers might call it a national treasure 3 with a much larger threat there is still enough contagious suspense thriller eye candy and brilliant still shots of rome to breathe in fans of the book might feel differently towards the movies drastic changes but considering the amount of blasphemy and inaccuracy it generates a d does exceedingly well at keeping the viewer locked on to the screen this time rather than on their sleepy shoulder a good book to movie adaption that will both appeal and entertain 7 4 10	positive
this is probably one of the best french movies i had seen in a very long time this pastiche or parody of spy movies is very well made and is going to make you laugh from the beginning to the end some references to today's world are very subtle the whole maroccan context of the movie is to be understood in light of today's french culture environment that said all the jokes and seemingly shocking remarks that could have been understood as such because of this context are permitted and accepted because this is a parody i was told by my sisters who had already seen this movie that i should go too and assured me that i was going to have a great time and indeed i had if you liked the old 007 movies with sean connery and also like movies like airplane or hot shots you will be delighted i just hope this movie is released on dvd in the us wait and see	positive
i thoroughly enjoyed this film overall but four things really stand out sam raimi's perfect comic timing and performance as the camp handy man alan arkin's wonderful characterisation of the camp owner and best of all the cinematography the beautiful golden tones of the exterior scenes draws me into the film like a sunset at the lakeshore draws me into my own summer memories the dialog and mood feel very natural and believable some reviewers criticise the lack of a more profound script to me it is exactly that lack that makes this film work the characters and their problems seem real and because of that i care about what happens to them the bottom line is that all the parts come together to create a whole that feels right	positive
in one of the best of charlie chaplin's lengthier short films he places the little fellow in the trenches of wwi where he brings his intolerable politeness and endless patience to the drudgery of trench life where troops lived for months at a time before finally going over the top to overtake the enemy and usually to their deaths it takes someone of chaplin's skill as a comedian to make something as dreary as trench warfare into such a brilliant comedy but the irony that he uses in the film makes even the most uncomfortable conditions highly amusing like all of the best of chaplin's films short films and otherwise this one is packed with brilliant and memorable scenes such as the scene where he marks off kills with a piece of chalk on a board in the trench erasing one when he gets his helmet shot off the scene where he and his fellow soldiers are sleeping underwater the opening of the beer bottle and lighting of the cigarette and of course the overtaking of the enemy all of these scenes are show stoppers reminiscent of the most wonderful chaplin scenes this one should not be missed	positive
this version of david copperfield is dreadful from start to finish i knew we were in for a wasted evening's viewing when a rather silly to the point of embarrassment attenborough and olivier camp it up as two baddies it was all downhill after this aunt betsy was adequate but had none of the eccentric flair she was noted for the worst of the worst was the producer's choice for uriah this was the music hall version of this character previously and admirably played by roland young and what was all this self absorbed angst from david dickens must have rolled over in his grave to see his favorite child turned into a wimp weeping in his beer this was one time when hollywood knew more than jolly old england	negative
twenty years ago the five years old boy michael hawthorne witnessed his father killing his mother with an axe in an empty road and committing suicide later on the present days michael gordon currie invites his girlfriend peg stacy grant and his best friends chris myc agnew jennifer emmanuelle vaugier lisa ann kelly benson ned brendon beiser mitch maldive phillip rhys and trish rachel hayward to spend the halloween in the country with his grandparents in their farm he asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest innermost fear and together with his indian friend crow byron chief moon they would perform an ancient indian celebration using the carved wooden dummy morty jon fedele that would eliminate their fears forever the greatest fear of michael is to become a serial killer like his father but something goes wrong and morty turns into his father killing his friends the fear resurrection is a disappointing and pointless slash movie that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the greatest innermost fear of each friend before it grows but in a messy screenplay full of clichés there are some exaggerated performances like for example ms betsy palmer others very weak but in general the acting is good unfortunately there is no explanation why the dummy is brought to live further in spite of being surrounded by close friends the group does not feel pain or sorrow when each one of them dies the low pace along more than fifty minutes could have been used to built a better dramatic situation in the very end michael shows a charm that his father was interested that i have not noticed along the story i do not know whether the previous reference was edited in the dvd released in brazil with 87 minutes running time the special effects are very reasonable for a b movie my vote is four title brazil fear 2 uma noite de halloween fear 2 one night of halloween	negative
early talkie feature based on a popular stage play a murder has been committed and a bunch of people hire a medium to conduct a séance to see who the murderer is while the lights are out there's another murder so it's someone in that room what follows is an obvious dull and creaky murder mystery most of the cast overacts to a ridiculous degree they act like they're on stage where you have to overdo things and it looks silly on screen most embarrassing is bela lugosi two years before dracula who really overdoes it as a police inspector static direction by tod browning who was always overrated doesn't help for browning and lugosi completists only i give it a 3	negative
you have to see this i could not stop laughing about the stupidities i saw in this movie even late after the event there is maybe a million of individual mistakes and stupidities in this movie the acting is bad the story is so predictable and flat the effects are like 50 years old the supposed thriller is nowhere you will not enjoy the movie but you will laugh at it and enjoy laughing at it a long time after it we had a great time after the movie truly me and my friend spent entire 40mins long bus trip home chatting about this movie like we have seen next oscar winner sadly we were talking about all those bad things we had just seen	negative
shadows breathes the smell of new york's streets like no film before it this kick off of cassavetes' directorial work is as atmospheric as political and the initial spark for a renewal in american cinema maybe it solicits for watching cassavetes' first work in a double feature with another debut godard's à bout de soufflé both films shaped the cinematic production of their countries beyond decades and both breathe a peculiar lightness and jauntiness which was later rarely achieved by those filmmakers in their career shadows tells from three afro american siblings ben ben carruthers lelia lelia goldoni and hugh hugh hurd the story is set in the new york jazz milieu and the driving rhythms on the soundtrack play a main part for the feverish sometimes almost dreamlike atmosphere which draws through the entire film there's not much happening in the plot the everyday life of the three siblings is defined by problems in love relationship or in their jobs but on both levels normality deceives without moralizing gestus cassavetes simply describes the mechanism of racial exclusion in public and in private life it was regarding to the cinematic depiction of racism a breakthrough film in the us this film owes also a lot to the performances of the three leading actors which were all almost completely unknown before especially ben carruthers established with his energetic portrayal the image of a new self conception of young urban blacks in america an image which characterizes spike lee's films of the 80s and 90s revealingly none of those three doubtlessly extremely talented actors was able to start a big career afterwards hollywood wasn't and isn't ready to ethnically expand its star system and that is why goldoni hurd and carruthers only found small artistic niches in tv and independent films later on perhaps shadows is one of the less beautiful films ever shot and one of the most beautiful ones at the same time a film of shades and spaces with a camera that merely watches the stream of life in the crowded street corners bars hotel lobbies apartments inducing an intriguing ramble through new york's vibrant streets	positive
this film has good characters with excellent performances from the cast david strathairn is diabolically sincere as the child molesting salesman and danny vinson plays a perfect pussy whipped southern husband the slick soundtrack betrays the murder ballad tone of the film	positive
my reasoning behind viewing this film despite the fact that it was free was more or less out of curiosity slight slight curiosity i wasn't all that familiar with this straight to video biographical account of mr gein and discovered during the opening credits that it featured horror icon kane hodder in the starring role my emotions turned from not just curiosity but now a glimmer of mild anticipation as to how his portrayal of gein would turn out also in the credits among some grim photos of ed's crimes was michael berryman and priscilla barns okay i thought to myself this may be mildly amusing as the movie started and progressed slowly my microscopic confidence or as i call it micro hope for this movie faded entirely and i was stuck with an overwhelming feeling of humiliation as i died a little inside from watching this dung heap hodder who is widely known and respected for his past work as an unstoppable serial killer inaccurately puts that into play here turning eddie gein from a mild mannered recluse to a hulking full blown killing machine he lurks by night killing cemetery caretakers his grave robbing buddy and teenage girls leaving plainfield in a panic as the local sheriff's department seems to do nothing to adjust the dangerous situation in the least the deputy and his mom have a warm little relationship that gave me a fuzzy feeling inside or that could have just been the cyanide pill i ingested halfway through this turkey i'm not sure what the point of this movie was and obviously the director knew nothing about the subject he was working with there is already such an abundance of films pertaining to gein's story that unless the ed gein snuff footage is discovered i don't want to see anymore of these on the shelves if you want a more authentic film of this nature than check out 2001's ed gein aka in the light of the moon	negative
i very well remember the bad press this film got because of the producers' court order against clayton moore using the name lone ranger or donning his black mask at personal appearances quite apart from any consideration of the film's quality this was the absolute height of nearsighted arrogance and stupidity on the part of the producers and their attorneys and i suspect that the lesson was well learned after this film tanked which was widely perceived as some sort of karma for the jerks responsible for the court order against moore in more recent times it has become the custom when reviving a legendary film or tv project to invite the original star or stars for cameo appearances and rightly so show some respect you idiots and even if they turn up their noses at the prospect which has happened at least the offer was made this is proof positive that film producers studio executives and entertainment attorneys are not quite too stupid and arrogant to be taught by example	negative
the first murder scene is one of the best murders in film history almost as good as the shower scene in psycho and the acting by robert walker is fantastic a psychopath involved with tennis star in exchange murders that s the story and overall this film is very good but theres one problem why dosen t guy haines go to the cop in the first place 4 5	positive
this was a complete disappointment the acting isn't bad but the production was just so bad that at times i felt i needed to stop it but i sadly made it through and was able to finish it a bit embarrassed by the whole poor movie it is o k if you are o k with cheesy moral plots and don't mind watching a movie that vastly misconstrues whitman if you want a cheesy fictional story go for it	negative
i found this dvd in the store and figured why not support some indy film and watch a cool horror flick please save your time and money and pass this one by the acting the script practically everything with this film is sub par there really isn't much of a story and there is no character development i found myself not caring what happened to the people in the movie as long as something happened everyone is supposed to be college age but they all look like they are in their mid thirties except for the woman who plays a mother who looks like she is pushing 40 in fact the worst part of the film is that every single scene is shown in a master shot there is no editing no cut ins or close ups do yourself a favor and skip it	negative
take one look at the cover of this movie and you know right away that you are not about to watch a landmark film this is cheese filmmaking in every respect but it does have its moments despite the look of utter trash that the movie gives the story is actually interesting at some points although it is undeniably pulled along mainly by the cheerleading squads' shower scenes and sex scenes with numerous personality free boyfriends the acting is awful and the director did little more than point and shoot which is why the extensive amount of nudity was needed to keep the audience's attention in the nutty professor a hopelessly geeky professor discovers a potion that can turn him into a cool and stylish womanizer whereas in the invisible maniac a mentally damaged professor discovers a potion that can make him invisible allowing him to spy on and kill for some reason his students boring fodder don't expect any kind of mental stimulation from this and prepare yourself for shrill and enormously overdone maniacal laughter which gets real annoying real quick	negative
this movie was like the disney channel after dark take out the aren't we naughty language and themes and you are left with dialogue and plot devices that insult the intelligence of anyone who doesn't describe saved by the bell as quality television the dialogue so laughably cliched and knowingly dirty one might think the screenplay was the product of locking aaron spelling and joe eszterhas in a room with orders to produce an amalgam of every bad script each had ever had a hand in creating if that was roger kumble's intention mission accomplished	negative
alexander nevsky is nothing short of a grand film on a grand scale the film opens a window to a world and culture most americans will never become acquainted with and much has been said and written regarding the film's thinly veiled patriotism in the face of imminent war with the german nazis by us standards the acting is a bit stilted the screenplay is short on words and big on visuals and action and while the action can become tiresome the visuals are often stunning direction is incredible on another note fans of ralph bakshi animation might notice that he stole a lot of his visuals for wizards directly from a copy of alexander nevsky	positive
while both this movie and the signature car chase have been shown a lack of respect by many critics both are way above average roy scheider does an excellent job playing his best type a tough courageous cop who works hard to get the job done in spite of the desk drivers and politicians who should be supporting him rather than hindering he played a suburbanized version of this same role as the tourist town police chief in jaws not nearly as gritty but the same get the job done despite the politicians and gutsy approach if a man who can't swim and is terrified of everything in the water going out on an old boat with an ahab wannabee and a nerd to confront a huge killer shark isn't gutsy then tell me what is tony lo bianco is good as a surprisingly complex villain most of the villains in fact have some depth and complexity this is one of those movies that gets better with repeated viewings overall it captures the atmosphere of parts of ny city gritty unglamorous often dangerous but filled with energy the story is spare tight and subtle it gets the job done without extraneous elements it may not be one of the all time greats but it is an exceptionally good movie everyone has an opinion about car chases mine is that this one is right up there with the mustang vs dodge charger chase in bullitt the pontiac ventura chevy nova was similar to the mustang in being a compact car chassis with beefed up suspension and a powerful small block v8 stuffed into an engine bay meant for an insipid 6 the ventura novas got little respect off the drag strip but with the proper suspension mods they made affordable performance cars that could handle on both the road and the track the bawling of those gm v8's as they wind up is music to the enthusiast's ear i've heard this chase criticized for imitating the bullitt chase the truth is that they are two works by the same master bill hickman who also choreographed and drove for the french connection chase besides driving most of the car chase scenes he created a brooding malevolent presence and a good match with richard lynch as a pair of coldly evil killers yes the chase has realism errors often noted like the use of 3 different ny roads to represent the palisades parkway the ending of the chase in a crash with an 18 wheeler on a roadway for passenger vehicles only and the miraculous timing that allows all pedestrians to escape harm that's beside the point let's face it movie car chases are unreal by nature in bullitt the french connection and the seven ups however bill hickman and phillip d'antoni crafted chases far more realistic and therefore more exciting than the flying rolling exploding vehicle fantasy chases so common in recent films	positive
oh god what a horrible horrible film meant to be a comment on the state of society it's just a reflection of the worst of the worst in reality tv interstitials hosted by jason jones and don mckellar are the most obnoxious part written in a tone that is perhaps meant to be reflexive and insightful rather these moments are mind numbing as they speak to the camera with dialogue written by someone with a love for insulting condescending speech that shoves the meaning of the film down the viewer's throat also a point to would be filmmakers long takes and quiet scenes do not equal art neither do extreme angles or logic stretched to the point of absurdity if anyone out there is interested in watching this film please don't seriously please you have better things to do	negative
where to begin how best to describe just how awful this movie is let's start with the campy hick humor it isn't very funny add a bunch of musicians impersonating actors meat loaf is horrible and deborah harry is even worse pity poor art carney who should have known better than to do this movie and then there is the plot a roadie whose life goal is to work an alice cooper show meets a girl whose life goal is to be a groupie for alice cooper at least they get what they want and then just when the movie should end they can't come up with a more plausible last scene than a well i won't ruin it for you if you really want to see the movie there are certain actors that let you know that this is going to be a b movie or perhaps worse gailard sartain is one of them for me and he has a more prominent role that's a sure sign that the movie probably won't be very good if nothing else the movie lives up to the low expectations even exceeds them by being worse than poor let's just say this this is the movie against which all bad movies are compared and none are worse than roadie	negative
i'm surprised this movie is rated so highly although if i were to go with typical grade scale 71 is a c or d so perhaps that's all right but this movie was just a typical thriller except boringly slow and unrealistic not that a typical thriller is realistic but this one seemed to be trying to and yet the woman who got rapped didn't press charges because she didn't want to be cross examined in a court even though she would be putting the man who broke her arm beat the crap out of her and raped her away for life not but also protecting the lawyer whom she had feelings for and his family not just random people she didn't even know there were other similar problems with the movie which would have been all right if there was some kind of moral to take away from the movie but the few moral questions like whether it was right to try to kill beat kady before he did anything illegal were presented a little one sided since kady ended up being just a crazed bastard bent on revenge so sure the lawyer was justified in protecting his family since waiting for kady to actually rape his daughter so he could do something legally about it would be a bit absurd so now i've just waisted more of my life for this stupid movie so please don't see it so at least your life won't be waisted and that way my 2 1 2 hours or so has meant something	negative

after i read that ''at the time of its release in 2002 its budget of 47 million or 327 000 000 frf was said to make it the costliest french film ever however astérix et obélix contre césar 1999 had a budget of 48 million or 274 620 000 frf which supposedly made it the most expensive french film ever'' i discovered the reason why i found this movie to be one of the most beautiful and colorful of all i have ever seen i loved the scenarios the clothes specially the ones from cleopatra and the atmosphere of the movie it's so happy and cheerful i found the jokes smart and hilarious and i have to consider this movie to be in my favorite comedies of all times the cast is also excellent with monica bellucci who is very beautiful as cleopatra gérard depardieu great obelix christian clavier jamel debbouze that i saw for the first time in ''amélie poulain'' among others i recommend this movie even for people who doesn't know asterix and obelix comics you are going to have a great amount of fun aka asterix e obelix missão cleópatra brazil	positive
unless you are between the ages of 10 and 14 except for the r rating there are very few things to like here one or two lines from kenan thompson david koechner we really should see him more and sam jackson are humorous and julianna margulies is as good as she can be considering her surroundings but sadly that's it poor plot poor acting worse writing and delivery the special effects are dismal as much as the entire situation is an odd and awful joke the significant individual embedded situations are all equally terrible if we consider the action portions well there are unbelievable action sequences in some films that make you giddy and there are some that make you groan this movie only contains the latter kind this leaves little left i'm so glad i did not pay for this despite any hype i can read and think so as i sat down to watch i did not expect anything good i had no expectations but was somewhat worried going in yet like a train wreck one cannot merely look away and even with no expectations i was let down bad not even 'so bad it's good' material i'm _very_ tolerant of bad movies but this makes six string samurai which i liked oscar worthy no this piece of over cgi'd rubbish is in the same company as battlefield earth little man and gigli how this is currently rated a 7 2 completely mystifies me brainwashing or somehow stacking the voting system is all that i can think of as answers i could go on and on but suffice to say that tonight i witnessed a train wreck i need to go wash my eyes 1 of 10	negative
this film is really something of a curate's egg good in parts in contrast to other reviewers i found that the main fault with it is its inability to draw in the viewer's interest in the characters and the plot i sat through it because i'm interested in rock'n'roll and the dynamics of bands but if i were to evaluate it purely on the basis of its merit as a movie i would have to give it the thumbs down with a few caveats jason behr is good in the part of john livien and quite convincing as a rock singer the narrative regarding his childhood trauma is unclear although we are given hints in livien's well acted relationship to his parents but his behaviour is ultimately bizarre to the viewer which it shouldn't be nevertheless the idea of using a stage persona to solve inner conflicts is interesting albeit not novel nor fully explored as a theme in this film the allusions to john lennon were irritating but i confess i'm not a beatles fan at any rate livien and his band reminded me more of oasis than the beatles in the sense that there was something derivative about them another frustrating thing about the movie was the way it opened up with some interesting albeit middlebrow and high school level philosophical musings of the lead character but left the threads of his thinking there only to pick them up again in the middle of the film very briefly when livien says before god there was music ever seen that ad for tia maria in the 1990s before time there was tia maria that's what sprung to mind anyway it seems an idiotic conclusion and the viewer has no idea how he reached it but he's entitled to it fortunately his bassist and friend played ably by dominic monaghan seems to acknowledge the fallacy of this thinking when he responds you don't know that in all the limited strengths of the direction and the plot could go either way on future projects into pointless banality or into an interesting and more mature perspective	negative
if you love cult 70's sci fi the way i do or if you like movies such as repo man or buckaroo bonzai than you're going to love this one it's a stream of consciousness 70's sci fi spectacular including a 22nd century junkyard and the earth a million years from now this movie is pure 70's put on steve miller's fly like an eagle or pink floyd's dark side of the moon and you're ready to go	positive
i absolutely love this show but i saw the second episode first after watching the first episode i could see why people were turned off at first the first episode's humor is not the best and they struggle to properly start the series however i still like the light and humorous attitude of the show the characters develop much more after the episode and become truly enjoyable characters as a first episode it really doesn't accurately represent the rest of the show which is really quite good the episode is not bad by any means but as the show progresses it becomes better and better so watch more episodes before passing any judgement on the quality of the show	positive
i saw this movie a couple years back i could'nt sleep and there was nothing on so i peeped it what really gets me is it makes no sense and thats why its disturbing richard gets tied up in chicken wire and jarvis starts making out with richard's girl while she's unconscious then jarvis's buddy troubador is playing some stupid song on his guitar by the next morning it shows richard's girl talking to jarvis and trouby and then she walks back to richard and looks at him while he's still tied up then they play some happy music and the movie is finished i mean what happened did they brake up and what was she saying to those 2 guys trouby and jarvis its to puzzling and to poor to i can't stand movies that are disturbing and don't make sense this was the worst film i've ever seen since the 90's version of lord of the flies	negative
while it does crack the odd good joke the humour is generally quite dry with members of the panel frequently pulling faces or resorting to coarse language and waiting on the crowd to applaud lame enough jokes unlike what an other comment says i don't think this is the best rte have ever made its really dry and sarcastic sarcasm is the lowest form of wit there are few truly funny intelligent gags that would make you genuinely laugh out loud people seem to be convinced by the comedians well known names rather than by judging the quality of the gags which aren't really that good overall its mediocre with some good laughs to be had but often it can be fairly mediocre its not as good as jasper carrot or dave allens stuff i find benny hill funnier	negative
matthau is a widowed hospital doctor enjoying his single status and the footloose and available nurses on the staff whilst colleague and friend richard benjamin looks on with amusement and amazement their boss is hard of hearing going on senile chief of staff art carney who is up for re election to that post matthau is content playing the field without commitment until he meets single mother glenda jackson who insists upon being the only woman in his life while she is in his life at the same time he comes under pressure to respond to the amorous advances of a potential litigant in a malpractice suit and to support the shambolic and incompetent carney in his attempt to be re elected chief of staff this is a superior old fashioned romantic comedy graced by four grade a actors and an excellent supporting cast working with a first rate dry caustic and sarcastic script carney steals every scene he's in and in the parlance of imdb has us rolling on the floor laughing out loud whenever he appears on screen we are otherwise entertained by the on off relationship of the two leads and various sub plots lacks the ambition to be a great film but remains one of the best of its kind and watchable and re watchable for its comedic value alone deserves more attention than it seems to have received and well worth the cost of the dvd or video cassette	positive
i am salivating for the sequels i needed something to keep me from going insane with tension anxiety what if it isn't as good and constant lack of information i needed something to calm me a little something to pass the time other than of course the matrix this was just the thing i found it informative like the part about keanu's neck and some of it was funny i pitied carrie anne soooo much when she said there was only one bathroom and all those guys i found only one problem with it given that 95 of the people there were as a matter of fact male they just kinda let their mouths run wild and there was language in it it's not near as bad as the shawshank redemption's cussing runs but that one scene were keanu is describing a bad day plug your ears if you are little it was entertaining and was just what i needed it is what all matrix fans who are going nuts need to keep them quiet they mention a tiny bit about the sequels and someone almost gives something away but he catches himself in time shoot it gives you almost no spoilers but it is great to have if you are a matrix head like me there is no spoon	positive
usually i don't think hollywood productions are fit to be called film so i call them 'movies' instead but this piece of elephant manure is not even fit to be called a movie hence the quotes in the title where shall i start 1 if this isn't the start of geriatric casting it sure is the epitome of it stefanie powers is supposed to play someone even less than half her age she's supposed to play an 18 year old and she is forty effing two 2 a horrible and stupid mindless portrayal of paris and france where we see cliché characters such as the sympathetic grumpy shop owner the bitchy queen of models the fairy god mother ex queen of models etc this film is surpassed only in this respect by the da vinci code which reviewers correctly determined was a comedy 3 it's highly and utterly ridiculous to have no nudity in a film about a time and a place where nudity was so common place especially if the whole focus is about that 4 the horrible accents 5 the nana mouskouri elevator music i could go on but i think this is enough and i was able to make these observations after watching this crap for just half an hour while surfing the internet and talking to my friends about math equations i mean i invite everyone to add to my list p d	negative
i used to always love the bill because of its great script and characters but lately i feel as though it has turned into an emotional type of soap if you look at promotional pictures posters of the bill now you will see either two of the officers hugging kissing or something to do with friendships whereas promotional pictures of the bill a long time ago would have shown something to do with crime this proves that it has changed a lot from being an absolutely amazing police drama to an average type of television soap when i watch it i feel like i'm watching a police version of coronation street or something similar i have to say i still like the bill as i'm interested in police work and that type of thing but i really miss the greatness that the bill used to have i want to rate it as 2 out of ten because you have to admit it has been totally ruined by the people who took the bill over as for the script and characters they have both gone downhill most of the great characters are gone now although a few still remain i think and i'm not saying that the newer characters are poor or anything because they definitely aren't its just that they lack the tough looks personalities and script lines that all of the old characters used to have because most of the new ones are at the moment involved with silly relationships and family trouble overall being one of the only police programs on television these days the bill will always be a crappily interesting thing to watch but like i say it has lost a lot of its uniqueness if thats the right spelling and would now be classed as a terrible unreal television soap recommended to watch for a good laugh over the stupidity of the police officers involved 2 10	negative
i had seen this movie before but i could not remember it was this fantastic it has a fun plot madonna fumbles around the city with pumas etc causing a commotion and the music is just perfect and the happy ending who s that girl is a great choice for a romanticist like me in my opinion this could be even the best madonna movie i have ever seen 10 10	positive
when the first trailer for this film was viewed by myself i was curious as to what angle the storyline would take after all the plot of having one's childhood self return to the present leaves open many options bruce willis however does a superb job in the role he was given i was surprised to see just how well he could act in this part this is also a good career move as many others have said but after seeing it i now agree this film is mainly about remembering the kid you used to be and coming to the realization that you aren't the adult you planned to be this is a wonderful story and a gripping tale that makes us all think usually we scorn at what if movies for example waterworld attempted to answer the question what if the world were to be covered with water and but truthfully nobody cared this movie however effects everyone in the theatre true young children may not fully grasp the idea of growing up and having all your dreams fizzle away but it leaves a great impact on the adults and parents of those children this movie is definitely worth seeing although it will be better the second time around because you won't be thinking so much about how the kid got there and why and all that stuff just relax and have fun and take something with you when you leave that cinema take that piece of your childhood you've forgotten and enjoy it	positive
i saw this movie and was bored out of my mind i am a fan of peanuts but i can't understand why charles schultz let this disaster be made spoilers ahead i can't believe snoopy would let his friends sleep on the ground outside in a dangerous situation and go out to a bar and swig a few cold ones without standing watch the story was complete nonsense even for comic strip characters it takes them toooo long to get to france plus once they get to france i had a feeling that the writer i still can't believe it was schultz didn't know what to do once they got there peanuts is best made in 30 minute episodes not 80 minute movies go home charlie brown you are at your best there	negative
deliverance is a stunning thriller every bit as exciting as any good thriller should aspire to be but also stomach churningly frightening though it is not a horror movie it is just as terrifying as any classic horror film the very thought of being a normal red blooded male enjoying an adventure weekend miles from any form of civilisation only to be captured and sodomised by a couple of violent hillbillies is surely the worst nightmare of 99 9 of the world's population it would have been easy for deliverance to slip into exploitation territory but john boorman has cleverly avoided the temptation to go down such a route and has made a film that explores questions and challenges the very meaning of masculinity with so many films you come away wishing to heaven that you could step into the hero's shoes performing heroic deeds and saving the day and getting the girl but with deliverance you come away praying to god that you'll never have to experience what these four protagonists go through four city guys ed jon voight lewis burt reynolds drew ronny cox and bobby ned beatty head out into the wilderness to spend a few days canoing down a soon to be dammed river the guys are riding the rapids in pairs and ed and bobby inadvertently get a little too far ahead of the others so they pull in to the riverside and await their pals in the adjacent woodland here they fall foul of two local woodlanders bill mckinney and herbert coward who tie ed to a tree while one of them strips and rapes bobby instructing him perversely to squeal like a pig lewis and drew arrive unseen and lewis being a fair archer kills the rapist while the other hillbilly beats a hasty retreat into the forest under great emotional stress the four canoeists decide to conceal the event and get out of the area but they find the river increasingly dangerous to negotiate as they journey downstream and the risk to their lives heightens when the surviving hillbilly returns to take shots at them with his rifle from some unseen vantage point in the rocky cliffs beside the river deliverance is very powerful as a survival tale but even more powerful and disturbing as a study of macho attitudes being torn apart and left in humiliated tatters though all the performances are remarkable one must take particular note of beatty's efforts in a role that many actors would've turned down the film is very similar thematically to the 1971 film straw dogs both films deal with terrifying sexual violence in isolated locales and in both the eventual violent revenge exacted by the victim does not result in any sense of satisfaction the backdrop of the rugged countryside in deliverance is beautiful to look at but it also adds to the tension by placing the four canoeists in a setting where they are at the mercy of the hillbillies and the landscape with nobody to rely on other than themselves this truly is suspenseful film making at its finest	positive
on the surface the idea of omen 4 was good it's nice to see that the devil child could be a girl in fact sometimes as in the exorcist when girls are possessed or are devilry it's very effective but in omen 4 it stunk delia does not make me think that she could be a devil child rather she is a child with issues issues that maybe only a therapist rather then a priest could help she does not look scary or devilish rather she looks sulky and moody this film had potential and if it was made by the same people who had made the previous three films it could of worked but it's rather insulting really to make a sequel to one of the most favoured horror trilogies as a made for tv movie special on so many levels it lets down it's cheap looking the acting is hammish and the effects are typical of a tv drama the characters do not bring any sympathy and you do not route for them i recently re watched it after someone brought it for me for christmas and it has dated appalling if your thinking of watching this then i would suggest that you don't watch one of the others or watch the exorcist or watch the good son just don't waste your time on this drivel	negative
this is an absolutely true and faithful adaptation of 'the hollow' it could be argued that the actual mystery here is not one christie's best but what makes 'the hollow' special is the characterisation and i found the actors here more or less without exception were perfect in their parts in such a uniformly good cast it's difficult to select stand out performances but i have to say that sarah miles is just perfect as lucy angkatell what is extraordinary is that she not only conveys lucy's dottiness tactlessness and her more lovable qualities but she also manages to pull off the underlying truth that in fact lucy is not really all that nice megan dodds is also very good as henrietta and claire price very affecting as gerda john christow is really quite an unlikeable character but jonathan cake nevertheless manages to make us see what his women see in him as i said the script follows the story quite faithfully the only disconcerting thing i found was that midge and edward's relationship really comes out of nowhere and i do believe that some of it must have ended up on the cutting room floor theirs a secondary story however and the primary story is very well done the whole thing looks beautiful as well really capturing a perfect english autumn its a beautiful film in every respect and well worth seeing	positive
i saw this movie back in 1984 we first started watching this is spinal tap and after 5 minutes we were ready to fall asleep so we went instead to see this movie if you have any conspiracy theory's going around in your head you will want to watch this one the question you have to ask yourself when watching this movie are do you think the government would be capable of doing this in my opinion there is no doubt that they could but i don't want to give out too much information as that would be a spoiler and i think that you should view the movie for yourself but just to let you know we still talk about this movie 20 years later and trying to explain it to people is not the easiest thing in the world to do	positive
in the white balloon and crimson gold the two other films by jafar panahi that i've seen the director mines surprising amounts of depth in subjects that seem on the surface slight in offside panahi's seriocomic tribute to iranian women standing up for their rights i don't think he's as successful not that what he's saying isn't important of course and it's too bad that like pretty much every other panahi film iranians can't see it but after a while the film feels a tad flat and it feels long even at 90 minutes not saying i didn't like it though the actors are all fantastic and the celebration at the end of the film is infectious but it's not an important work in my opinion	positive
it kept my attention to the end however without spoiling the film for anyone when she fixed the fridge by getting a book from the library you knew how the film would end when she went back to library for a book on self defence against and assassin the film for me said nothing of worth is becoming an assassin really a remedy for mental illness or just another symptom	negative
on the face of it ruiz has set out to make a psychological thriller although it's not as satisfying as a classic piece in that genre there are compensations the tensions generated between huppert and balibar as women calmly but calculatingly at war over a boy they both claim are compelling however in a true european art house style ruiz doesn't give us release of this tension as the women alternately also try to behave compassionately towards each other the only raised voice is that of huppert's waking from a nightmare an uncontested irrational event in the film in fact if we follow the title the film is as little about its thriller skeleton as jane campion's in the cut instead it is an intergender psychological study focusing on men the boy camille nils hugon decides on a practical joke playing his mother off against an emotionally vulnerable other woman both women seem to pander to him rather than scold and this compounds the problem in the background is an intemperate psychologist charles berling swift to confront the women in his life his sister huppert the nanny or his pa and so acting as a symbolic adult counterbalance to the calm and we learn manipulative camille it is particularly interesting that like the father in henry james' the turn of the screw denis podalydes' law enforcer father is absent for the duration of the film ruiz fashions an oedipal moment out of huppert's reaction to his return at the film's close read either as a thriller or as a psychiatric essay this film is ultimately rather disappointing i'm officially rather fed up with mme huppert's screen method which is too buried and so i'll be looking to see her on stage before i come back to her european enjoyed heaven's gate films again the support is good ruiz does the cast no favours though quite apart from some poor lighting and some wilfully odd shots its as if his direction has left characterisation quite out of reach i'm thinking particularly of edith scob's shamanic neighbour to isabelle who acts knowing but communicates bafflement the set pieces do not link up to a forward driving plot the tension i have already referred to is not only weakly dissipated but wasted in its directional potential want to see a good contemporary french thriller go and see l'appartement instead 4 10	negative
it came before the ten commandments land of the pharaohs ben hur and it's overlooked today how unfair based on mika waltari's mammoth novel it doesn't cheapen it waltari's novel was so huge only a miniseries could have done it justice i hope it will be done some day waltari whose message is essentially christian remains intact another of his books the secret of the kingdom first part takes place after christ's death in the holy land the egyptian is the rising of a monotheism close to christianism long before christ the pharaoh wilding is some kind of messiah who sacrifices his life because he knows that the true kingdom is not in the material world he asks to return good for evil and he has disciples who will eventually turn into martyrs the scene when simmons and the other worshippers of the sun god are slain is visually stunning looking like some pagan ballet for the priests on the other hand this new religion would mean the end of their influence on the populace and that's why they look for a strong man mature who can lead the army against the hittites as well as against their dangerous compatriots another religion or non religion should we say is sinouhé's purdom who during two hours believes in nothing the sequence of the grain of sands is absolutely sensational and rises the whole movie well above the average peplum there's another fascinating side the movie looks like a flamboyant melodrama not only for the screenplay notably pharoah's sister's tierney final revelation which predates the ten commandments by two years but also the splendor of the cinematography viviani in his book about curtiz talks about a baudelairian atmosphere blue and gold notably in the scenes which involve the prostitute darvi who contemplates her reflection in the water of her bath supreme narcissism around the hero all the characters appear disappear appear again but when they reappear they have followed their way and all the subplots come together with consummate skill besides as such is often the case in modern melodramas the story is a long flashback framed by two short sequences showing sinouhé an old man who's remembering this is a wonderful sword and sandals that had a strong influence not only in america but also in europa notably in poland where jerzy kawalerowicz directed a spellbinding faraon 1966 which owed a lot to curtiz	positive
i wonder why i haven't heard of this movie before it's truly a magnificent comedy i'd say farce but it's too well acted and i'd hate to denigrate it's quality a comedic character study about the travails of mid life crises the inequity for gays who can't have their long time unions recognized and the general differences of people who can't fit nicely into society that pairs kathy bates and rupert everett to a wonderful effect forget julia roberts and rupert kathy bates and rupert should do another movie together the anxiety ridden acerbic and outrageous daughter in law maudie meredith eaton is a truly wonderful character if you liked the tales of the city films you'd like this quirky charmer	positive

not that he'd care but i'm not one of simon pegg's friends if i was there's a good chance we'd fallout if he continued to make dross like this the trouble is he found a successful formula as the bumbling ordinary guy next door type in shawn of the dead run fat boy run etc but it's starting to wear thin here his character has no discernible qualities he's rude and obnoxious and thinks he's funny when he frankly isn't when transferred to new york from london and i presume this link is meant to appeal to viewers on both sides of the atlantic he proves equally out of place with his new colleagues still is it any wonder when amongst his jolly japes he hires a transvestite stripper to appear at an editorial meeting an act of revenge for his boss yet somehow kirsten dunst starts to warm to him even though he's done nothing nice oh and because he's a superficial male he falls for megan fox at first sight possibly because her character is as shallow as his it all makes for a predictable film conclusion although i can't see any viewer expressing how this mirrored their life the shame is that on paper this is a cast supposedly worth watching pegg though plays himself kirsten dunst seems to just go though the motions creating no on screen chemistry and megan fox isn't stretched at all the one huge plus is miriam margolyes as pegg's new york landlady now if she had been on screen longer	negative
i saw rachel's attic thinking that i would be in for an enjoyably visceral ride however it was not to be the case visceral yes but enjoyable that would be a big fat no in fact the only reason that i gave it a 3 is due to the fact that gunnar hansen appears ever so briefly as one of the film's reprehensible characters how they ever lured mr hansen into this piece of work i'll never know the story idea is interesting but poorly executed the direction is pedestrian and the acting is mediocre the only thing that is worse than that are the special effects yikes i've seen better effects in a grade school play give it up mr w it's time for a career change i hear they're hiring at mel's diner there are very few well made inde movies coming out of michigan and rachel's attic isn't one of them	negative
welcome to a bad ghost story and someone's nightmare this horror tale finds a newly married husband john hudson and wife peggy weber haunted by the memory of his previous wife and screaming skulls found throughout their empty mansion and lily pond is the husband really trying to drive his already anxious bride insane or is it the learning challenged gardener mickey alex nicol who has taken care of the mansion's grounds since the death of the original mistress of the house this low budget horror flick has a story line that keeps you involved all the way the finale special effects are pretty bad even at 1958 standards i swear at times the screaming skull sounds much like it should be in a godzilla movie also in the cast as reverend snow is character actor russ conway by the way the lurking gardener nicol is the film's director you can catch this as part of amc's monsterfest	negative

aro tolbukhin burnt alive seven people in a mission in guatemala in the 70's also he declared that he had murdered another 16 people he used to kill pregnant women and then he set them on fire this movie is a documentary that portraits the personality of aro through several interviews with people that got to know him and through some scenes played by actors based on real facts aro tolbukhin is a serious work so analytical it's not morbid at all such a horrifying testimony about how some childhood trauma can turn a man into a monster my rate 7 10	positive
people who know me say i have a weakness for animated films to be fair those people are half right my actual weakness is for exceptionally well done animated films such as this vintage family flick from max and david fleischer you may be thinking to yourself well if it's so great why haven't i heard of it fair question this movie was released the same week as the attacks on pearl harbor the unavoidably bad timing caused the film to sink into relative obscurity things are looking up though because it has finally been released on dvd under the title bugville it's funny that the film went through all this because it kind of mirrors the actual plot although some people claim that the movie is trying to send an environmental message ugh i personally think that the movie's main idea is perseverance through adversity and hard times after all the country had barely pulled out of the depression at the time our grasshopper hero hoppity desperately wants to help his endangered community problem each time he tries whether through the ill will of others or through simple bad luck he fails miserably and slowly begins to earn the disdain of the very people he's trying to save although he does his best to maintain a positive outlook he occasionally breaks down and it's only through the encouragement and support of his friends that he gets back on his feet and fights the good fight just a healthy reminder that when all is said and done no one is really self sufficient okay you're saying it has a good message two actually does that really make it exceptionally well done my answer partially it's not just the message that makes this movie special it's the characterization this is one of those films where you can just see the personality of each cast member in their animation you almost don't even need the spoken lines a good way to sum it all up is energetic or lively a lot of movies have used the selling point lovable cast of characters whenever i hear that line it always makes me think of this movie case in point the bad guys swat the fly and smack the mosquito many movies have lovable villains but i don't think you'll find any as entertaining or endearing as these fellows forget that 3 stooges cartoon from the 60s swat and smack are the closest thing to an animated version of moe and curly but sadly not larry that you'll ever find virtually all of the funniest moments somehow involve this gruesome twosome yeah they're rotten no goodniks but you still care about them that's the kind of power you only see from a really talented writer director and crew the movie has two brief jokes revolving around racial stereotypes native americans and chinese i don't think they were intended to be malicious but they're there regardless they didn't bother me but it'd be pretty unfair of me not to warn someone who potentially would be bothered by them so if you share my weakness and i think you do give this one a go	positive
a plane carrying employees of a large biotech firm including the ceo's daughter goes down in thick forest in the pacific northwest when the search and rescue mission is called off the ceo harlan knowles lance henriksen puts together a small ragtag group to execute their own search and rescue mission but just what is knowles searching for and trying to rescue and just what is following and watching them in the woods oy what a mess this film was it was a shame because for one it stars lance henriksen who is one of my favorite modern genre actors and two it could have easily been a decent film it suffers from two major flaws and they're probably both writer director jonas quastel's fault this film which i'll be calling by its aka of sasquatch has just about the worst editing i've ever seen next to alone in the dark 2005 and quastel's constant advice for the cast appears to have been okay let's try that again but this time i want everyone to talk on top of each other improvise non sequiturs and generally try to be as annoying as possible the potential was there despite the rip off aspects any material related to the plane crash was obviously trying to crib the blair witch project 1999 and any material related to the titular monster was cribbing predator 1987 ed wood like exposition and ridiculous dialogue the plot had promise and potential for subtler and far less saccharine subtexts the monster costume once we actually get to see it was more than sufficient for my tastes the mixture of character types trudging through the woods could have been great if quastel and fellow writer chris lanning would have turned down the stereotype notch from 11 to at least 5 and spent more time exploring their relationships the monster's lair had some nice production design specifically the corpse decorations ala a more primitive jeepers creepers 2001 if it had been edited well there were some scenes with decent dialogue that could have easily been effective but the most frightening thing about sasquatch is the number of missteps made for some reason quastel thinks it's a good idea to chop up dialogue scenes that occur within minutes of each other in real time so that instead we see a few lines of scene a then a few lines of scene b then back to a back to b and so on for some reason he thinks it's a good idea to use frequently use black screens in between snippets of dialogue whether we need the idea of an unspecified amount of time passing between irrelevant comments or whether the irrelevant comments seem to be occurring one after the other in time anyway for some reason he doesn't care whether scenes were shot during the morning afternoon middle of the night etc he just cuts to them at random for that matter the scenes we're shown appear to be selected at random important events either never or barely appear and we're stuck with far too many pointless scenes for some reason he left a scene about cave art in the film when it either needs more exposition to justify getting there or it needs to just be cut out because it's not that important the monster's intelligence and humanity could have easily been shown in another way for some reason there is a whole character mary mancini left in the script even though she's superfluous for some reason we suddenly go to a extremely soft core porno scene even though the motif is never repeated again for some reason characters keep calling harlan knowles mr h like they're stereotypes of asian domestics for some reason quastel insists on using the blurry cam and distorto cam for the monster attack scenes even though the costume doesn't look that bad and it would have been much more effective to put in some fog a subtle filter or anything else other than bad cinematography i could go on but you get the idea i really wanted to like this film better than i did i'm a henriksen fan i'm intrigued by the subject i loved the setting i love hiking and this is basically a hiking film on one level but i just couldn't every time i thought it was going to be better from this point until the end quastel made some other awful move in the end my score was a 3 out of 10	negative
oh dear oh dear i started watching this not knowing what to expect i couldn't believe what i was seeing there were times when i thought it was a comedy i loved how the government's plan to capture the terrorist leader is to air drop in one man who is unarmed and expect him to capture him and escape with a rocket pack if only it were really that easy i've finally found a movie worse than plan 9 from outer space	negative
this movie is great simply it is rare that you find a comedy with levels and this is a bloody good example of such when i saw this movie first as the credit rolled a friend and i looked to one another and asked 'did you just catch that ' for those doubters look at the levels see the comparisons between vick and the people in the club the dna see the diverse characters each jostling for position and if you see nothing else see the connection between the cure of vick and the path through the film it's all in vick's head the opening line about vick's world the closing scene with the camera going into vick's head and inside a whole universe thoroughly quotable wonderful cartoon gangsters beautiful beautiful beautiful	positive
i do not generally appreciate light weight attempts at creating humourous stories which means that anita no perd el tren cannot score very high for me the story is good a middle aged but still good looking woman finds a new love but the attempts at making this film as a romantic comedy only managed at times to be somewhat comical rosa maría sardà has ably demonstrated that she can be a serious actress in such productions as amic amat qv todo sobre mi madre qv las amargas lágrimas de petra von kant qv and el embrujo de shanghai qv however the powers that be have over the years dished her out a lot of trivial stuff for the cinema and for tv something similar could be said of josé coronado perfectly able to produce serious performances maría barranco belongs safely in this grouping such that in the end i was left with the feeling that i would be real pleased to see a new making of this film in a serious tone which would allow the actors to really show their performing skills and the curious thing is that it should be done with exactly the same leading actors wasted talent on a rather silly film that could have been very promising indeed	negative

i can appreciate satire that goes against my own views but it must be witty and well placed this film is how can i possibly explain it it does not make the slightest attempt at subtlety much less intelligence in fact it's hardly even horror dead soldiers come to life but they're not interested in brains only in voting booths why cue a never ending stream of the most idiotic banal bloated windbag ravings of bad president bad conservatives bad republicans what a self indulgent schmaltzy cornball piece of hog manure this was even if they agree with the episode's points only the stupidest of liberals would say they enjoyed watching it then again assigning a degree of stupidity to the crazed angry hostile anti social and anti anything halfway normal liberal spectrum is a tall task in itself avoid like a liberal convention	negative

in the seemingly endless quest to find well made well acted horror films it is all too rare to find one that even comes remotely close to hitting the mark needless to say i was very pleasantly surprised when i stumbled across burned at the stake on a u s cable network while i was flipping channels the premise is reasonably simple in 1692 young ann putnam swift is the most vocal witness against alleged witches leveling baseless charges against anyone who earns her displeasure manipulating her for his own ends is reverend parris peters who also serves as the court's guide on matters pertaining to witchcraft and satanism things get complicated when ann starts accusing members of the goode family of witchcraft salem of 1980 or so loreen graham also played by swift begins having unusual visions shortly before she visits the salem witch museum a strange man in seventeenth century garb tries to accost her there and the building he continues to stalk her while strange phenomena begin to involve her more and more soon it appears that she is becoming possessed by the spirit of ann putnam unfortunately further description gets rather involved and would give too much away though the film is not action oriented and would likely be of little interest to many viewers the performances are good and the seventeenth century dialogue used in the film's many flashbacks sounds very convincing the production values are solid with the possible exception of some of the special effects in a side note the film's technical advisor was laurie cabot salem's official witch viewers who appreciate a well made atmospheric but understated horror film may appreciate this the writer director bert i gordon has had a long career in horror and science fiction filmmaking and is best known for his work on a number of big bug films and similar works years earlier	positive
the real surprise of this effortlessly lightweight movie is how such a top notch cast got assembled for what is nothing more than a hammy uninspiring affair presumably it was a proverbial snowball rolling down a hill gathering pace and size and shape one can imagine that by the time miranda richardson got contacted by her agent the conversation went along the lines of 'do you want to shoot a movie in dublin scripted by neil jordan michael caine and michael gambon are already in ' this is a dull 'comedy' that sees michael caine and dylan moran try and pull off a well planned hustle where moran must imitate a london gangland boss whose arrival is imminent to collect a sizeable sum of cash from local kingpin michael gambon the rest is simply a forgettable romp that is thankfully over quite quickly moran is mildly amusing in places but on this evidence is better suited to life on the small screen in hit comedies such as black books caine is unchallenged in his role and gives a steady performance without being overstretched one can only imagine what made him sign up for this movie it can't even have been a summer in dublin given that many of the scenes look positively autumnal in the background gambon actually steals the show and anyone who has caught some of his performances in the likes of have i got news for you will know that he is a wonderfully funny man but overall the result is disappointing and it seems a lifetime ago that neil jordan was making quality movies of the likes of mona lisa	negative

as a habit i always like to read through the 'hated it' reviews of any given movie especially one that i'd want to comment on and it's not so much a point counterpoint sorta deal i just like to see what people say on the flipside however i do want to address one thing many people that hated it called it to paraphrase 'beautiful but shallow ' some even going so far as to say that norm's desire yet inability to help his brother was a mundane plot at best i'd like to disagree as a brother of a sibling who has a similar dysfunction i can relate daily you see them abuse themselves knowing only that their current path will inevitably lead them to self destruction and it's not about the specifics of what they did when how or why paul decided to take up gambling and associating with questionable folks it's really more how they are wired on one hand they are veritable geniuses and on the other painfully self destructive it's a lot like people like howard hughes the same forces which drive them are the same forces which tear them apart and all the while you see this you know this and what's worse you realize you can't do a damn thing about it for norman maclean a river runs through it was probably a way to find an answer to why the tragedy had to occur and who was to blame in the end no one is and often there is no why but it takes a great deal of personal anguish to truly come to this realization sometimes it takes a lifetime and sometimes it never comes at all	positive
well since seeing part's 1 through 3 i can honestly say that they should have never made part 4 everything from the tacky and i do mean tacky score to the really bad acting i dare anyone to watch this and not be bored out of their minds i mean parts 1 to 3 kept the vibe strong on the plot of damion but without him around in this one it's just not the same sure by the end of part 3 i was getting a little tired of the continued story line's but it was a good closure at the end of the third one again there was no reason for a part 4 even if there was they could have done a much better job than this sh t i had to sit through lol there goes an hour and a half of my life i'll never see again	negative
i get a kick out of the new who fans who call it excellent their entitled to that opinion but the new series isn't quite there yet it's getting there it's definitely good first the good things the special effects are obviously better nearly 20 yrs later since the last episode of doctor who battlefield was aired one thing the bbc has always liked is doctor who except when they tried to cancel in the 70's and 80's however the anticipation and the pressure was great but i think the new series has passed the test it's good it's still not excellent because it does have it's flaws some of the stories dalek were very poor i assume it was written in a couple of minutes by some idiot who never bothered to remake the dalek character or never bothered to watch the old series aliens in london was by far probably the best episode so far it started a new storyline about aliens which has lasted across several episodes including boomtown now the other bad things the companion rose billie piper isn't great she's actually quite annoying but as is dr who a young teeny bopper had to be eventually chosen and she got the part christopher eccleston is pretty respectable he's started to catch his niche he tried to play the character straight then funny always missing the right punchline but he's taken it much more serious and it shows continuity wise there still some issues that didn't get resolved well paul mcgann was still the doctor before this but he didn't get put back aside from that though the series overall is pretty good i haven't missed an episode and it never gets boring so i recommend any doctor who fan to check it out and see the new doctor who series	positive
nathan detroit runs illegal craps games for high rollers in nyc but the heat is on and he can't find a secure location he bets chronic gambler sky masterson that sky can't make a prim missionary sarah brown go out to dinner with him sky takes up the challenge but both men have some surprises in store this is one of those expensive fifties mgm musicals in splashy colour with big sets loud music larger than life roles and performances to match broadway photographed for the big screen if you like that sort of thing which i don't my main problem with these type of movies is simply the music i like all kinds of music from albinoni to zz top but broadway show tunes in swing time with never ending pah pah tah dah trumpet flourishes at the end of every fourth bar aren't my cup of tea this was written by the tag team of frank loesser mankiewicz jo swerling and abe burrows based on a couple of damon runyon stories and while the plot is quite affable the songs are weak blaine's two numbers for example are identical unnecessary don't advance the plot and grate on the ears and are also flagrantly misogynistic if that sort of thing bothers you there are only two memorable tunes luck be a lady sung by brando not sinatra as you might expect and sit down you're rockin' the boat nicely performed by kaye but you have to sit through two hours to get to them the movie's trump card is a young brando giving a thoughtful laid back performance he also sings quite well and even dances a little and is evenly matched with the always interesting simmons the sequence where the two of them escape to havana for the night is a welcome respite from all the noise bustle and vowel murdering of noo yawk fans of musicals may dig this but in my view a musical has to do something more than just film the stage show	negative
just saw this film at the fantasy filmfest berlin i am not impressed as far as the story goes too girlfriends return from their mexico vacation while waiting for their luggage they get to know a couple of boys who then take the last and of course wrong shuttle bus to the city on board is also one other older man so weirdly portrayed that you instantly guess that he is one of the bad guys the other one is the driver the shuttle takes them into industrial wasteland and then one after the other goes done a little blood some cut of extremities some violence mostly playing with the fear of the girls in the end after some ups and downs heres and there's some not too new scary moments everyone is dead but the driver and the girls the girls end up in some garage where one of them is killed after confessing that she had slept with the other girlfriends boyfriend the other girl which is the conclusion is sold by the left over kidnapper yep weirdo got killed in some cargo box to asia a freight harbor being the final picture first story tons of loopholes questions you ask yourself loose ends and a conclusion that is not a good revelation but a total disappointment i can't see how such a unprofessional looser is supposed to have abducted dozens of women as is indicated by a drawer full of drivers licences aha second acting mediocre at its best third scare factor ok but i am bored by torture as a means to nothing but itself trade with humans could be a good reason for a horror flick but it's not used as one just as a background fourth music and sound some nice tries but the sound possibilities of the industrial landscape warehouse garage and truck sounds have not been really explored music would have been worse without it but apart from that some pseudo moving synth string theme for emotionality when the girls reach their final destination ok i guess verdict avoid it	negative
this film was a new direction for natalie portman a much more adult role though she comes to it from the traces of a child in the movie itself ann portman and susan sarandon who plays her newly divorced mother adele travel from a small town in the middle of nowhere to beverly hills there these tortured souls try to come to terms with their new life and their new relationship as portman's character grows up unknowingly at first to adele she grows up and becomes a better mother for it ann sees her mother telling her she wants to be an actress or so she thinks adele uses that crutch every time there are problems in their lives we see their struggle as mother and daughter come to terms between themselves and with being alone having left their old lives behind the acting is top notch from both of them they seemingly become mother and daughter before your eyes you can almost feel there is a bond there beyond the actual movie though this movie really doesn't take us to any new ground in these types of films the fact that the acting is well done and the story isn't too flawed let's me recommend it i will say however it will probably go away soon i don't believe it can have the staying power needed for a huge christmas season of movies starting in a week or so see it now before this happens if you like either of these actresses	positive
the narrative was clear and concise but overall the film never caught my interest scenes felt flat and uninspired ghengis khan historically speaking had a very interesting epic life but the film failed to capture that instead focused on small skirmishes as a youth and a love story i think i've seen disguised in a slew of other films i never felt sympathy nor empathy for the lead yes he had to overcome slavery but then seemed to have an easy ride to khan pillaging killing and double crossing his way to the top the one redeeming quality was the photography the landscapes certainly helped the bleak atmosphere of the film unfortunately combined with the bleakness of the story i left unmoved and disappointed	negative
after having seen the canadian icelandic british 2004 production of beowulf grendel which i thought brilliant and stunning i approached this the first of 3 newer beowulf movies due out this year with trepidation as soon as i heard viking and saw the horned helmets i groaned these were migration era swedes and danes not vikings they came later and even the vikings never wore horns on their helmets horns make it easy for your enemy to knock your helmet off and then brain you then there's hrolfgar's palace which looks like a set for a movie about greece or rome not 6th century denmark the swords and armor look like props left over from earlier films set in various historic periods i spotted weapons that might have been used by crusaders in kingdom of heaven and one character was even wielding a windlass steelcrafts reproduction movie sword from beowulf grendel beyond the basic plot of the original epic poem the writing was dismal and the acting totally wooden and unconvincing the biggest yuk was a secret weapon crossbow complete with sighting scope and exploding projectiles that looked like something bought from iraqi insurgents the special effects monster and his mom were so on steroids that beowulf could never have torn off an arm as he did in the poem thank the gods for bazooka crossbows i could go on but i won't	negative
thank you hollywood yet another movie classic utterly ruined by a cheap shallow effect heavy and redundant remake the original planet of the apes was an intelligent and thought provoking movie with a very clear message it was a movie that focused almost entirely on dialogue which sounds very dull but was in fact very interesting this movie on the other hand seems to have done away with pretty much all the dialogues instead of a great movie we get an incredibly stupid two hour chase movie dialogue has been reduced to a mere minimum character interaction and development are non existent and most of the time it's extremely hard to figure out what's going on instead we get a bunch of pointless action scenes some marginally funny one liners and some very hollow quasi intelligent conversations the only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic the make up of the apes is magnificent and the sets and backgrounds are beautiful too however this does not distract from the fact that planet of the apes 2001 is a very shallow and simplistic movie filled with paper thin characters stupid dialogue and a nearly non existent plot please hollywood stop ruining great movies by turning them into senseless blockbusters oh yeah the ending did not make any sense whatsoever out of stars mainly for the visuals	negative
ok so this is horror i get horror but i don't get horrific black white is artistic but too much black is overkill enough said about the lighting the story a serial killer lot's of these around it's been done in the past and yes it will continue to be done but i hope not my question is when will the audience tire of reliving this maddening dilemma i guess the director thought he would do something different portray killing children well that's been done before too so i guess he had to go to shock value have them killed in the darkest of fashions okay the audience was shocked sickened disgusted numbed and getting up out of my seat i felt all of these things so was the director successful yes absolutely these are the things he wanted me to feel and i did now what do i do with the feelings and more importantly what is the message here with the amazing talent that francis xavier was gifted with could he ever consider applying it to making films that speak of dare i say coming out of the darkness i was left in the dark after viewing this film my soul was assaulted is that what this craft is about there are many such films out there they make the bucks i'm told so what's up with the people that want to see all these deploring visuals what is going on in this world that people will pay to be horrifically shocked would i see this again not ever	negative
i shall begin with a disclaimer this movie is not recommended for anyone who lack interest or have never played ff7 the game before watching the movie relies on the audience's knowledge of each character in the game to convey story plot elements and it does so very subtly do your homework before watching this wonderful piece of cg film and i promise it'll be that much better with that in mind this film has some of the most spectacular cg sequences i have ever witnessed the whole experience felt like an extra long fmv sequence from the game on steroids yeah the attention to detail in each scene especially in the heavy action oriented ones is so impeccable it left me with a sense of awe i believe the soundtrack is simplified so as to help the audience focus on the animation quality more than the music again for those who are familiar with the ff7 story and background the music should not surprise anyone although the timing and placement of each soundtrack from the original accompany each scene and mood to the point where the music simply enhances the animation once again i myself having only played through ff7 once thoroughly enjoyed this piece of art from square enix and that is the feel in most scenes choreographed and organized like a dance in short if you enjoyed the music or the game final fantasy 7 this film will blow you out of the water if you're in the unfortunate majority who has not experienced the goodness known as ff7 on playstation or pc doing so before watching the movie will allow for an exponentially greater experience finally i just want to make a note of the quality in animating this film characters move with fluidity each scene background comes to life and tells its own story for those who criticize the thinness and dependency of the story plot i urge you to reexamine the animation facial reactions subtle clues that bring about another level of entertainment above the typical narration method of story plot delivery square enix and the great tetsuya nomura has set a new bar for quality animation and storytelling advent children has ushered in a new era for cg animations allowing the subtleties that lie in each character to speak volumes in and of themselves thanks square enix the wait was well worth it	positive
i really only watched this movie because it had rupert grint in it who i knew as ron from the harry potter movies i had never really appreciated rupert as an actor until this movie i loved the entire film rupert does a wonderful job in this hilarious quirky movie i think the movie could have been fine without the sex but it worked somehow i can't wait to see more of rupert's films in the future julie walters also did an amazing job in the harry potter movies she has a very small role so i didn't quite know what to expect from her either but she was wonderful as dame evie the part where she swallows the key was absolutely hilarious overall an amazing movie	positive
i love just about everything the late al adamson directed in his long and varied career but the possession of nurse sherri stands head and shoulders above fun yet admittedly grade z schlockfests like horror of the blood monsters and dracula vs frankenstein this film is actually scary am i saying that you're going to jump out of your seat when you watch nurse sherri no of course not but this pastiche of elements from the exorcist ruby and carrie is one of those nice eerie little horror movies common to the seventies you can't put your finger on what's so spooky about it but the film drips with atmosphere and what an ending don't worry i won't spoil it for you adamson and producer sam sherman really nailed it with this one and it doesn't matter whether nurse sherri was a calculated success or a happy accident jill jacobson is likable but not outstanding as the hapless nurse who becomes possessed by the spirit of a recently deceased cult leader bill roy who shines in his brief role geoffrey land is okay as her surly doctor boyfriend there are some blaxploitative elements here profit was the bottom line with these cheap drive in flicks after all but they actually contribute to the plot rather than just being window dressing nurse sherri was a poverty row production and it shows at times sets special effects etc still the film has heart mostly decent acting and direction and some genuine chills sam sherman also saw fit to use harry lubin's theme music for the late '50s early '60s television series one step beyond in this film which certainly adds to the creepy atmosphere the dvd contains two significantly different cuts of the movie the early version features a lot of t a that wound up on the cutting room floor to make way for more horrific stuff as well as the theatrical trailer the tv spot and a great commentary by sherman does anybody know whatever happened to bill roy by the way next to john carradine he's the best actor i've ever seen in an al adamson film and he plays the cult leader like he means it	positive
this movie narrate the story of john belushi based of his biography wired' wrote by bob woodward all of movie is narrate on flashback without a chronological order where after the death of john belushi we see one angel accompany belushi during few points of his life michael chicklis in the character of john belushi is enough credible but entirely devoid of the devastate force of belushi and his play stay only a pale animation the director on more not succeed to give continuate on the story that for who not knows the book is very confused but the worse is that they have featured bob woodward that spoke with belushi before he died for this negative points the movie is only a would be attempt to narrate the controversial story of john belushi my rate is 4	negative
no blood no sex though it oozes passion no special effects but just one of those pearls that comes across your movie screen when you're not really looking and grabs your attention great acting great sets great music beautiful storyline if only there were a lot more movies made like this one the sets move us through time and make us feel like we were there the acting appears like real life and elevates us to the level of awareness of nanny to whom no one is a lost cause least of all the inhabitants of her own halfway house best of all it's a true story of misfits learning to fit in i was somewhat jealous of the good times that everyone appeared to be having in the movie could we all spend some time in nanny's house	positive
this film was excellent the emotional power of tom hulce and ray liotta's performances brought tears to my eyes and joy to my heart this film shows us that there is still hope in the world if this film had come out at the end of 1988 instead of rain man hulce would certainly have been at least nominated for a best actor oscar definitely a must see	positive
i saw the star of this movie on the daily show and thought i might tune in the movie premiered on comedy central then went into theaters oh vey this makes shakes the clown look like citizen kane avoid avoid avoid at all costs not one laugh not even a grin this movie will make your face come out in pimples and your eyes burst like the last remants of raiders i can't even think of a worse movie be it manos or ishtar as the pythons beckoned run away run away why did anyone green light this unless they used their own money the horror is that there is not one good line not one good joke and only one bad thing the making of this movie i feel that if made properly this would have been hilarious as it is i need a new pancreas for retching so loud damn anyone involved in this travesty	negative
this is a romantic comedy with the emphasis on comedy for a change as usual the lovers sally field as almost over the hill soap opera queen celeste talbert and kevin kline as marginally employed and marginally talented actor jeffrey anderson are working at cross purposes seemingly unaware that they are madly in love etc owing a little to bette davis's margo channing in all about eve 1950 and a whole lot to the slapstick theatrical tradition sally field goes over the top towards hilarity as she malaprops her way to love and happiness kevin kline one of the more underrated leading men of recent years is also very good and very winning as he manages to be handsome vulnerable egotistical and lovable all at the same time the misadventures center around celeste's fear of losing her audience as she has entered her forties and reach the crisis point with the arrival of her niece aspiring actress cori craven elisabeth shue who turns out not to be her niece with ensuing plot complications cori manages to get a small part in the soap opera as a homeless deaf mute before discovering her true relationship to celeste and to jeffrey anderson as well but never mind as a romantic counterpoint or foil to the leads are robert downey jr soap opera director david barnes and cathy moriarty montana and nurse nan david barnes is oh so hot for her but she cares only about one thing getting rid of celeste so that she might shine more brightly on the set to this end she gets barnes to do all sorts of things to wreck celeste's career but through happenstance and or a perverse logic all his attempts go awry much to the delight of the viewer whoopie goldberg plays rose schwartz the show's chief writer and celeste's alter ego and confidant while carrie fisher has a modest part as the hard as nails producer of the show i thought this was funnier than the only other spoof of the soap opera world that i have seen young doctors in love 1982 which burlesqued tv's general hospital and was pretty good soapdish is funnier with a daffy script and plenty of laugh out loud one liners and terrific performances by field kline and downy jr but see this for sally field who is outstanding	positive
this film as it is now is far shorter than it was when released in 1918 in fact it is now more available with two other medium sized silent chaplin features a dog's life and the pilgrim that chaplin re released in the 1950s in it's day shoulder arms was a big hit because of it's humor in uniform approach it still is very funny chaplin in disguise as a tree spying on the germans is so ridiculous it's hysterical but it suffers from being set in it's own age charlie's dealing with world war i a hideous conflict that killed 20 million people but not the worst war horrible to say of the 20th century chaplin would live to see that war too and would spoof it's main architects in the great dictator but the latter is more accessible to modern audiences because that movie is a talking picture also hitler as a target seems more important to audiences in 2008 than kaiser wilhelm ii and his general staff shoulder arms was to take us through the drafting of the tramp his training his getting use to trench warfare and his actual fighting against the huns on the western front much of this is now gone one segment when albert austin is a doctor examining chaplin in his office at the draft center is still in existence and was shown completely in the documentary unknown chaplin this is unfortunate because the film is now roughly forty five minutes long and there seems to be gaps that these scenes filled out what remains is first rate but one leaves wanting more and feeling a trifle cheated sydney chaplin and henry bergman do well in supporting parts especially sydney as wilhelm he had done it before in a short with charlie for the sale of bonds giving a militaristic speech before being clobbered by the tramp with a huge hammer labeled war bonds here we see the tramp succeed in capturing wilhelm and the general staff at the conclusion it was only topped by stan and ollie capturing the german army with a tank and barbed wire in pack up your troubles the funny thing is that chaplin actually had a major crisis as a result of his wartime activities he was not a naturalized american not in 1917 or in 1952 when attorney general mcgranery publicly announced that chaplin could not return to the u s because he was an enemy alien chaplin and his family were in europe on a trip in anger charlie settled in switzerland for the rest of his life except when he made a countess from hong kong and when he went to hollywood for his special career oscar in the 1970s because he was not an american he could not be drafted by the u s so he sold with douglas fairbanks sr and mary pickford u s war bonds but in great britain tens of thousands had perished in world war one battlefields and the public there was upset at chaplin who they considered a slacker and a coward chaplin eventually did overcome this but remnants of the resentment followed him until he died this does not detract from the success of shoulder arms as a film but it does suggest why chaplin did not do another modern war film until 1940 and a worthier target	positive
to make a good movie you either need excellent actors or an excellent director you need at least one of the two in this eye of the needle we have none i don't even remember the name of the director he mustn't have done much in his career i like very much donald sutherland but he absolutely cannot be the main actor in a movie he falls short sutherland is excellent in a movie when he appears for not more than 15 minutes i would say for instance that sutherland was excellent in jfk of oliver stone when he talked to kevin costner on the bench of a park for 10 minutes non stop without even taking a breath wonderful but sutherland being the principal actor in a movie is no good kate nelligan she is probably good for tv series the dvd is awful terrible colors terrible light i couldn't even appreciate the scenery of storm island for how lousy the photography was this ken follett story was good but it's a pity they turned it into an uninteresting movie	negative
i was watching this when my wife called to inquire from the other room as to my choice of fare my comment i am watching my life though younger but only by 5 years or so than the rocket boys i remember the absolute urgency with which sputnick was greeted by our administrators of education and how the whole science fair thing gained momentum and took me and others into the competitive whirlwind my own tornado landed me in my own state's science fair in physics by '62 though our group was less successful in gaining the support of for example firefighters we approached for guidance and counsel until after a tragic event our city went so far as to allow us to tour the nike missile site on chicago's lakeshore this movie brought it all back for me and i will bet that it brought it all back for a bunch of us ubernerds of the late '50s and early 60's we are in a similar science brain drainage period now and really need this movie as a country see it	positive
the end of suburbia teos is a very useful film it's also important and provocative there seems to be no middle ground with either the film or its main source of entertainment the anti sprawl meister james howard kunstler while i am not a big fan of the new urbanism my criticism of it is because of its small vision in the case of new urbanist peter calthorpe another talking head you finally hear what's somewhat obvious in and amongst the special added teos out takes calthorpe just doesn't understand peak oil i've used this as a teaching tool in economics classes to get at the importance of land as a factor of production a fact long diminished by neoclassical economics and also as a vehicle for educating about peak oil our wastrel land use global warming our threatened food production public transit our compromised future move over south park made by canadians from toronto for 25 000 and released in may 2004 this video sold over 24 000 copies by october 2005 one major dvd rental vendor recently ordered almost 400 more copies the end of suburbia sales were actually climbing 1 1 2 years after its release and it has also been available on one of the major online video services since september 2005 a sequel escape from suburbia is in the works with a possible release by august 2006	positive

the filmmakers try to paint the influence of the mondovis and robert parker as a travesty on par with the german occupation of france and the reign of fascism but they never find a victim in this film we hear wine makers critics and distributors bemoan that while the wine industry grows it becomes increasingly homogeneous but the film never makes a case that this has resulted in the loss of any good wine or exploitation of any person or culture other than naive wine spectator readers with lots of cash if they want to pay hundreds of dollars for a dull wine so be it if this were a film about the diamond trade where the debeers corporation's market domination results in human suffering the muckraking style might have been appropriate but as it is it just comes off as anti american anti modernization and anti capitalist had the filmmakers been around in the 1870s they most likely would have protested the grafting of american vines in the effort to save french wine	negative
movies like this make me wonder what modern horror would be like if someone had mercifully for movie fans put an end to m night shyamalan inside the womb this garbage is a prime example of what kind of lame random uninspired last minute generic plot twists have become the norm since movies like the sixth sense and the others were released this was an okay movie until the writers took a dump all over whatever of the mediocre script they had written and decided hey here's an interesting idea lets throw in a wacky twist at the end and make the main character the murderer that'll throw the audience for a loop what an original idea	negative
time travel is theoretical so i can give the script some leeway i also understand the concept that by changing just one variable you can potentially change the way history unfolded what i cannot understand however is the way the change in time unfolded we are subjected to a series of timewaves which progressively retrograde planetary evolution while this is a convenient plot device as it allows our heroes enough time to resolve the problem it makes no sense whatsoever surely if you change a variable and that variable has significantly or even completely altered planetary evolution then by the time you come back to the future the evolutionary process has already been established and there would be no need for waves after all why would a change that happened 65 million years ago need to wait until now to be effective the fact that the moth was projected forward in time may give it some credibility but the life of that moth 65 million years ago was significantly altered ergo any change to evolutionary history would have begun then and not be dependent upon a return to our current time to solve the problem the team goes back in time to prevent the change in variable from ever happening by doing this successfully we see that the changes to evolution never happened and that no one even remembers the events surely what works for the solution should work for the original change i like a good rollicking sci fi adventure but unless it is set in a galaxy far far away it needs to have at least some grounding in theoretical possibility to make it truly entertaining good premise bad plot reasonable acting and in all fairness just a twist on jurassic park not on my watch again list	negative
i'm not going to criticize the movie there isn't that much to talk about it has good animal actions scenes which were probably pretty astonishing at the time clyde beatty isn't exactly a matinée idol he's a little slight and not particularly good looking but that's ok he's the man in that lion cage we know that when he can't take the time away from his lions to tend to his girlfriend he will end up on an island with her and have to save the day someone said earlier that it is a history lesson the scenes at the circus are of another day especially the kids who hang around i didn't realize that even back in the thirties they sailed on three masted schooners it looked like something out of 1860 i guess that's the stock footage they had no wonder the thing got wrecked they're always talking about fixing her up there's even a dirigible it tells us a little about male female relationships at the time a kind of giggly silliness but if you don't take it too seriously you can have fun watching it	negative
this is without a doubt the greatest film ever made it is nearly incomprehensible even with many repeated viewings in an attempt to figure out what exactly's going on the film was almost entirely improvised and includes random musical numbers commercials contests one enters by mail and a host of other innovations besides what other movies have cameos by martin luther king jr to decipher the film hunt down the director's book entitled i was curious it'll all become clear it's a grand and bold experiment in improvised recursive filmmaking a triumph now if only someone would put out a version with the subtitles in a color other than white the white subtitles tend to wash out and become invisible	positive
spoilers this was an ugly movie and i'm sorry that i watched it like jan kounen's dobermann it suffers mostly from poor editing or lack of it it is as if the director was so in love with his work that instead of cutting the movie down to a pace that kept your attention he added all of the footage he had shot together there are maybe two cool scenes in the entire movie one of them is spoiler when benkei is petrified and the camera starts spinning around him that was cool but okay we got it move on please the camera won't stop spinning around this guy there's maybe one or two more cool scenes that i forgot about in this flood of mediocrity but the last duel scene is not one of them it may be because unlike in the earlier sword handling scenes shanao isn't masked but just because the director couldn't find a stuntman who somewhat resembled asano tadanobu doesn't give him the right to go ahead and make up 80 of the sword fight with extreme close ups of sword clashes and all from the same angle may i add the director should learn from the american produced 1995 bullet train ninja movie the hunted i personally saw the village raid scene as a tribute paid to the social activists of the previous generation who were confronted by the police in the violent demonstrations of their college years the situation where innocence is oppressed by an authoritative and armed branch of the government unwilling to understand seems to be a message common in the japanese media due to the strong influence of socialists and communists who are a political minority the movie versions of gto and salary man kintaro are two other recent examples end spoiler i don't understand i just don't understand why people who don't speak the language of the movie find praise worthy material in this maybe the worst was lost in the translation the ending of the movie on which marketing played a lot is a different interpretation of the legendary encounter between shanao and benkei but that legend is not the most popular in japanese folklore and it is so detached from contemporary themes that after 138 minutes of over played visual techniques who cares how the director wants to re interpret the story director sasaki hirohisa of crazy lips said that there was an unpleasant trend among new japanese directors to ignore japanese audiences and target their movies for foreign film festivals in order to gain faster international fame this works although it doesn't make sense because the point of an international movie fest is to introduce to the world what kind of movies are being made in other countries what kind of movies people watch in those countries certainly not gojoe and the like	negative
the hills have eyes is not a great film by any stretch of the imagination for one the villains look almost normal not what you would expect deranged lunatics to look like for another the pacing is very slow at times and there are many scenes of the characters repeating themselves by that i mean there is a lot of filler in the movie with a lot of running around aimlessly the film didn't have a clear direction the plot of the movie is hardly original even for its time the texas chainsaw massacre came out a few year earlier and is a much more effective film as far as horror goes the film has little in the way of scares and the pounding soundtrack just served to be both grating and distracting all at once i suppose the music was used to cover up the fact that not much happens through much of the movie though it failed in its intended purpose i basically kept looking at the time every few seconds hoping something would happen or it would end when something finally did happen any promise the film had was ruined by mere chaos and loud noise i sat through it because i like to give a film the benefit of the doubt yes there is some loud screaming and yes people die but who cares much too slow getting to any sort of pay off if you can call it that my buddy enjoyed it so at least one of us got something out of it the hills have eyes isn't the worst film we could have watched but i doubt i will watch it again this film was remade in 2006 and i will also have review of that version anyway this movie was painfully slow at times while other times was chaotic and repetitive unless you like watching paint dry occasionally interspersed with someone running around your block screaming their head off stay away from this movie a better bet would be the original texas chainsaw massacre 1973 1 5 out of 10 which is being generous	negative
i saw this one remastered on dvd it had a big picture of sandra on it and said starring sandra and made it seem like she had a big part in it not so she's barely in it she does what she can with the script but that's not much the sound was awful by that i mean things didn't go together shots would be fired and the number of shots didn't correspond to the sound people talking in a car while it's moving and the shot is from outside the windshield but there's no motor noise road noise or any other sound kind of weird score was awful it sounded like the same few notes over and over dialog really awful acting was awful i couldn't believe any of it fight scenes were like a batman comic without the biff and bam they were really lame the shooting scenes i mean with firearms were laughable literally i fast forwarded through a lot of this movie even then it was too long	negative
riding giants is an amazing movie it really shows how these people lived back then just to surf their lives were basically surfing living breathing and having fun they didn't care about money jobs girls or any thing to them the waves were their girls i have never been on a surf board and it looks so hard i don't understand how they can stay on them it makes no sense at all this is an awesome movie and if you love surfing then you should really see this movie if you're a surfer and you want to find out who started surfing how it came into life who is really famous at it or what ever then you should really see it it might be a documentary but it is really good tara f	positive
there is an old saying that relates to the rousing new film by joe johnston that goes something like this the man who thinks he can and the man who thinks he can't are both right that is a highly presumptuous statement referring to self motivating and belief in an individual which in this movie stand true even after road blocks and family trouble stand in the way october sky is about a young man who believes in himself named homer hickam growing up in a strict traditional family in the 1950's homer loves in a small coal mining town where nearly every man grows up to be a miner all of his friends quentin roy and o'dell all think that their life after high school will be like everyone else's homer is not exited about that future one night while everyone stares at the sky a russian space craft called sputnik passes overhead this is something new for homer and he finds it spectacular and overwhelming from this point on his look at life will never be the same first he tells everyone that he wants to work in the rocket scientist area for an occupation flabbergasted at what he says his family passes that idea over their heads and continues with life as usual his friends however think that this idea may have some potential after all quentin is a very smart individual when it comes to this kind of thing when the four friends start to test model rockets and blow a white picket fence to smithereens then what seems to be a forest fire is scared by them they're forced to end their progresses the performances in this movie are absolutely riveting from start to finish all of the actors give performances as if this is the real mumbo jumbo here standing out in all of the glory laura dern as miss riley this very well may be academy award material if the judges can remember back to the beginning of the year when this film is released the characters are also extremely well developed not only to the filmmakers give clear apparent reason why homer is interested in the subject but they also explain to the audience how they are succeeding in their studding of rocketry we clearly understand all of the characters' motives and beliefs especially the father who is bent over on everlasting tradition the film unfortunately loses some of its momentum at mid point because of a silly recycled romantic sub plot involving homer's love interest and how his brother stole her from him this type of this is becoming so awfully common in high school movies not that this film is aimed at high schoolers the actors stare at each other mindlessly like the are in a trance i put up with it without complaining in 1997's inventing the abbots but i have had just about enough this but that is just a minor complaint with an authentic looking time period cinematography worth an oscar and clips of the real life homer and friends at the end whom all hit it big with their dreams especially homer this is the first great film of 1999	positive
i was just looking up who will love my children to buy when i came across this web site and an entry made by a fellow briton i am a great fan of this movie and would and have recommended it to all what i found comforting is to find someone else who also finds comfort in the good will of others i also have a son with aspergers amongst other things and it is also a fear of mine to think if anything ever happened to me and my husband that someone would not only want to take on just my beautiful 'normal' daughter but my special and gifted son also missing home and being able to relate to people raised with the same values as myself has more meaning than you know living here in the us i have yet to meet anyone who has seen this movie so to all of you reading this if you have not seen it make an effort to do so it is a very moving experience especially for anyone who is a parent or even if you just have a sympathetic bone in your body you will cry and beg after that you will count your blessings and to anyone who has ever been through an experience like or close to this one my heart goes out to you it makes me realize no matter how hard or stressful thing get just remind yourself that there is always someone worse off than you an amazing movie and what makes it more powerful is the fact that it is based on a true story do not be put off by how sad it is at the same time this movie is heart warming and makes you feel encouraged about the strength and goodness of mankind	positive
film noir is an overused expression when it comes to describing films every crime drama seems to be a noir but where the sidewalk ends really is a good example of what the genre is all about very briefly an overzealous detective andrews accidentally kills a no goodnik who works for the mobsters the killing is blamed on the father tom tully of a woman andrews meets and falls for tierney to save dad from old sparky andrews captures the rest of the mob and turns himself in the morally guilty cop is driven by impulses from the past his father was a thief who was killed trying to shoot his way out of jail but that doesn't excuse his actions after he accidentally offs the no goodnik in self defense he immediately goes to the phone to report the incident but he hesitates he's already in hot water with the department and this could finish his career then at just the wrong moment the phone rings it's andrews' partner and andrews tells him the suspect they're trailing isn't at home he hides the body and later disposes of it by slugging a watchman and dumping the body in the river what motivates a guy to do something so dumb okay his job was at risk but now he's committed multiple felonies at least i think they must be multiple i counted obstruction of justice assault disposing of a body without a permit littering first degree mopery and bearing false witness against his neighbor in the end we don't know whether to root for andrews or not the suspect didn't deserve to die true but it was after all an accident because andrews didn't know he was a war hero and had a silver plate in his head maybe it's that kind of ambiguity that made noir what it was among other things such as characteristic lighting if noir involved nothing more than black and white photography murder criminals mystery and suspicious women then we'd have to include all the charlie chan movies under that rubric andrews is pretty good he's a kind of mark macpherson from laura gone bitter he never laughs and rarely smiles even when seated across a restaurant table from gene tierney a situation likely to prompt smiles in many men he has no sense of humor at all his few wisecracks are put downs when he shoves a stoolie into a cab and the stoolie says careful i almost hit my head andrews' riposte is that's okay the cab's insured andrews could seem kind of wooden at times but this is a role that calls for stubborn and humorless determination and he handles it well his underplaying is perfect for the part little twitches or blinks project his thoughts and emotional states and i guess the director otto preminger stopped him from pronouncing bullet as boo let and police as poe lice never could make up my mind about gene tierney she does alright in the role of tom tully's daughter a model but she's like marilyn monroe in that you can't separate the adopted mannerisms from the real personality traits did tierney actually have such an innocent almost saintly persona when she answered the phone at home did her voice have the same sing along quality that it has on screen poor tierney went through some bad psychiatric stuff before there were any effective meds for bipolar disorder and andrews too nice guy though he appears to have been slipped into alcoholism before finally recovering and making public service announcements the dvd commentary by peter muller is unpretentious informed and sometimes amusing anyway this is a good film as well as a good example of film noir the good guys aren't all good although the bad guys are all bad maybe that ambiguity is what makes it an adult picture instead of a popcorn movie for the kiddies only one shot is fired on screen and nobody's head explodes sorry	positive
farrah fawcett has spent the better part of her post angel's career confounding us with an occasional noteworthy acting performance sandwiched in between her playboy frolics and letterman escapades but when it comes down to it there's no denying that this girl can act far from a story of epic proportions this well done tv movie is gentle quiet and occasionally moving fawcett plays the wayward black sheep daughter come home only to find that she missed the last days of her mom's life as well as the funeral much to the chagrin of her more stable and presumably more sensible sister brad johnson plays the love interest and a story unfolds with all the typical elements of telefilm drama but then there's always that confounding farrah to watch and she does indeed remain eminently watchable and yes i admit it i did have that farrah poster on my wall way back when silk hope gets three and a half stars out of five on the corkymeter bosley would be proud	positive
it was on a day in 1891 when scottish inventor william k l dickson surprised his boss thomas alva edison with his remarkable work in the development of motion pictures after many experiments dickson was now able to capture scenes of real life with his camera and reproduce them through his invention the kinetoscope as if a fragment of time were preserved in celluloid soon dickson's kinetoscope would become an enormous success as a new way of entertainment with many people eager to pay the nickel that was charged to be able to watch people dancing or acrobats performing stunts through the peepshow of the kinetoscope however the invention wasn't complete in order for it to capture on film the real life as we know it sound was needed on the movies so dickson kept experimenting and this short experiment kinetophone's first film was the result in this experiment codenamed simply as dickson experimental sound film director william k l dickson stands in front of a recording cone for a wax cylinder earliest method of recording sound with his violin on hands playing a song named song of the cabin boy the idea was to record the song into the cylinder at the same time that the camera was recording his movements in order to show that this was a motion picture two of edison's black maria laboratory decided to do a little dance in front of the camera unlike what author vito russo claimed in his book the celluloid closet this little dance had nothing to do with homosexuality as it obviously is a reference to the environment of loneliness of the lab akin to the lonely sailors to whom the song of the cabin boy was dedicated to the title russo suggests the gay brothers is actually anachronistic as gay had no homosexual connotation in the late 1890s sadly dickson was unable to achieve the desired effect and the kinetophone never could really produce the synchronized audio with images while he had the cylinder with the sound and the celluloid with the images the synchronization of the two elements was not exactly effective and the sudden appearance of auguste and louis lumière's cinématographe prompted edison's team to focus on projecting systems and eventually dickson left the company fortunately in 1998 dickson's cylinder with the movie's sound was rebuilt and film editor walter murch made a restoration of the experiment as it was intended finally dickson experimental sound film could be heard with synchronized sound just as its creative inventor had intended while it was not a successful attempt this outstanding film is a testament of the enormous genius of the father of kinetoscope 8 10	positive
cummings is falsely accused of sabotage and goes on the lam looking for the real culprit the familiar hitchcock theme of a man wrongly accused of a crime is nicely played out in this entertaining fare that has elements of the thirty nine steps and north by northwest although it is not as good as either of those classics there are some impressive set pieces including the finale on the statue of liberty the plot is implausible and unconvincing and after a terrific start it seems to run out of steam cummings is likable if somewhat stiff in the lead lane is the blonde but not the cool variety of the director's later films the supporting roles are generally well played	positive
this is an excellent tub thumper from the war years john mills leads a fine cast of regular british b movie stalwarts in a solo submarine attack upon a fictitious enemy battleship filmed in black and white it's well paced and also well placed considering that a war was going on at the time if anything it shows how seriously the authorities took positive propaganda the mission side of the movie takes place in genuine submarines things are cramped and claustrophobic the actors look suitably grimy and sweaty without being too offensive to the heroic palate other commentators have already drawn attention to the authentic little details like keeping the vessel trim and forgetting to read instruments as well as the engine room activities this probably is the first movie in which debris and a dead german is blown from the torpedo tube to fool an enemy destroyer and it's the only time i have seen part of the vessel exposed in a pretence of sinking a high risk gamble if ever there was one i'm a little sceptical as to whether or not a submarine could punch its way through a wire rope net submerged speed was barely twice that of human walking speed and the net would have had a great deal of 'give' also the engineer was at the same work station and operating the same levers both on the surface and submerged this too seems implausible as either diesel or electric engines were used and they were in different sections of the ship or so i'm told there was a wee bit too much shore side drama for my tastes but then this was a propaganda effort and clearly contained a subtle message for civilians to mind their behaviour as it could adversely affect service morale and therefor the war effort these niggles aside it's a pretty entertaining little adventure nowadays movies of such vintage tend to be screened in the afternoon whilst far more modern and inferior movies enjoy prime time but then it's no longer politically correct to mention the war in the presence of our european friends too many of them have guilty consciences or our own left wing fascists non of whom have ever fought for the freedoms they now take for granted as a submarine movie it is eminently collectible better than 'the enemy below' i think though less demonstrative not so authentic as 'das boot' by any means but not so gross either	positive
yikes i've seen quite a few bad movies in my days a lot of them in the company of mike tom crow and the others from mst3k so was the case with this one as well and even though i found the movie in itself quite funny it wouldn't have been nearly as fun without the mst3k commentary the movie is a prime example of really bad movies coming out of europe during the eighties horrible music horrible acting horrible plot what little there is horrible dialogue and really really really horrible editing cripes this might be called a turkey if it weren't for the fact that it's not unique in any way whatsoever it's pretty much the same kind of film that almost every italian hack of a director cranked out so try and get the mst3k version it's a pretty fun episode with mike and gang in quite good form	negative
this is a cute film starring spanky alfalfa and buckwheat from the our gang comedies set in the south during the civil war it may seem a little odd to see buckwheat as spanky's slave but this film is as charming as the best of the shorts with the same cast this was the only our gang feature film and i highly recommend it over the little rascals remake from 1994	positive
back when i was a kid and i lived with my sister she bought every horror movie she could find and this was one of them vcr's had just became a household item and we didn't have but about 150 movies and we watched the hell out of all of them i was at a yard sale the other day and i saw this vhs copy of blood legacy and i buy any horror movie i don't have and i knew this movie looked familiar i thought for a second and realized it was one that my sister had bought she had sold it years ago in a yard sale i am guessing who knows i didn't recall anything at all about it and i watched it the night i bought it and it refreshed my memory because of a few scenes i am not sure how i felt about it as a kid but i am sure i enjoyed it because it was new to me and i'd watch and enjoy anything back then i am a horror freak but there are certain requirements in order for me to consider it good and this one fell very short it was one of those talk talk talk and bore me to death types what death scenes you see are done using the shadow on the wall followed by blood splatter and thats if you're lucky you get that much the story is good and i have seen a few with similar plots so i think this one should be buried and forgotten don't watch this people unless you're hard up	negative

it's been close to ten years since i've seen either of the last two sequels to phantasm surely due to my still vivid remembrance of them not being very good that being acknowledged to this day i'm still a huge fan of the first two installments so i thought i'd go back and re experience the 'final chapters' part three is definitely the worst of the series since it obviously takes itself less seriously and throws in a bunch of confusing stuff that doesn't make much sense again kicking off right where the previous movie left us reggie saves mike from the tall man who vows to come back for him later but things aren't safe for long when they come across jody who is inexplicably able to the take the form of a sphere apparently his soul is held prisoner by the tall man so mike is then dragged into the sinister double pronged netherworld and reg has to find him along the way he meets up with a ten year old kid and a nun chuck wielding black chick named rocky who assist him throughout his journey there's really nothing memorable about phantasm iii other than how stupid and forcefully humorous it tries to be only one positive aspect that didn't even help the movie and that was the return of a michael baldwin and bill thornbury who reprise their roles for the first time since the original 1978 classic the problem is they pretty much make cameo appearances reggie banister is of course back in his starring role but his bumbling love sick attitude makes his presence far too annoying to like angus scrimm also just didn't seem entirely into his role he talks too much here and is nowhere near as menacing and creepy in contrast with the quirkiness that the movie seemed to carelessly resort to most people's opinion on this flick seem pretty impassive and tend to think it's still entertaining maybe i'm just too much of a nit picker but i just couldn't get into this one i remember disliking it when i was a kid and after re watching it i can safely say nothing has changed don coscarelli rocked the scene with his original low budget nightmarish legendary film phantasm which i still rank as my top favorite horror flick and his respectable sequel kept things moving and darkly surreal and gory but lord of the dead stupid title just looked too rushed and slapped together to me the inclusion of the two new characters tim and rocky the only thing missing was scrappy doo was a strong indication of coscarelli running out of ideas and seeing how far he could ride the franchise so it's a phantasm movie with very little gore nudity and quadruple barrel shot guns need i say more	negative
i am a big fan of the movie but not for the usual reasons i think travolta and winger performed at higher than average rates i think the sets were representative of the location and the era i liked the sound track and the charlie daniels band however i think the photography was amazing since the interior scenes were filmed in the actual club and gilley's had low ceilings perhaps 10 12 feet high and the smoke that was supposed to simulate a smoke filled bar hung 2 4 feet below the ceiling the camera managed to get shots through the smoke and focus on the actors the bull the bar the women the dancing the low level of light that actually was in the bar what a feat sure there was auxiliary lighting but in order to maintain the atmosphere of the bar it had to be low light shots ray villalobos the camera operator was outstanding he got some shots he had no hope of achieving and the impact of them brought a sense of reality to the film thanks ray great work	positive
i've seen this story before but my kids haven't boy with troubled past joins military faces his past falls in love and becomes a man the mentor this time is played perfectly by kevin costner an ordinary man with common everyday problems who lives an extraordinary conviction to save lives after losing his team he takes a teaching position training the next generation of heroes the young troubled recruit is played by kutcher while his scenes with the local love interest are a tad stiff and don't generate enough heat to melt butter he compliments costner well i never really understood sela ward as the neglected wife and felt she should of wanted costner to quit out of concern for his safety as opposed to her selfish needs but her presence on screen is a pleasure the two unaccredited stars of this movie are the coast guard and the sea both powerful forces which should not be taken for granted in real life or this movie the movie has some slow spots and could have used the wasted 15 minutes to strengthen the character relationships but it still works the rescue scenes are intense and well filmed and edited to provide maximum impact this movie earns the audience applause and the applause of my two sons	positive
this is a very good black comedy with a great view on how different people have a different perception of the same situations the three main characters each met a girl named jewel played by liv tyler who is a different male fantasy for each of the three men each of the three men go through the same situations but when they tell of them to other people their perception of the situation is very different from what the other two say that is a very good concept probably not entirely original but it works very well in the movie the plot is very good very bizarre and extreme which makes it a good black comedy the acting is equally good not one of the actors seemed out of place or out of their league the comedy is very black pitch black in some scenes and a lot of people will definitely be offended by it but fans of black comedy will probably enjoy it overall this movie is not for everyone's taste but most people who like black comedy will probably love it as it is definitely one of the better black comedies 7 10	positive

not sure why it doesn't play in peoria apparently but this is a very funny clever british comedy it's set at the end of the swinging sixties peter sellars is fantastic as the rich forty something serial womaniser the perfectly delectable goldie hawn playing a 19 year american girl in london is initially sellars' catch of the day but the urbane tv food critic can't stop himself from falling for the dizzy american blond humour pathos great script strong performances from the leads and supporting caste it's a great film and the best gag is the very last line try it you'll like it	positive
i caught this movie on the sci fi channel recently it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as b list horror suspense films go two guys one naive and one loud mouthed a take a road trip to stop a wedding but have the worst possible luck when a maniac in a freaky make shift tank truck hybrid decides to play cat and mouse with them things are further complicated when they pick up a ridiculously whorish hitchhiker what makes this film unique is that the combination of comedy and terror actually work in this movie unlike so many others the two guys are likable enough and there are some good chase suspense scenes nice pacing and comic timing make this movie more than passable for the horror slasher buff definitely worth checking out	positive
50 years old this musical comedy fantasy might look its age but it wears it with dignity this film is still great fun crosby was never really romantic lead material but he delivers the material with the lightly humorous edge it needs bendix plays broad and is huge fun in a part which calls upon his strengths hardwicke how joyous for a knight of the realm a genuine one to throw himself into caperings like this with such abandon and rhonda fleming enjoys herself in the least showy of the main roles only murvyn vye disappoints as an unconvincing merlin though not a musical the songs are very good and the dance routine accompanying busy doing nothing is perfect funny appropriate dexterous without being challenging and making a virtue out of crosby's musical movement which let's be fair was inherently amusing due ti its never being his greatest strength the colour is fine the sound is a little muddy in places and the story well it takes some liberties with the original but i suspect that mr clemens might well have been pleased with the result	positive
i had enjoyed the masters of horror series until i came upon this infantile dung heap this anti bush propaganda piece masquerading as a horror film comes off like an episode of the original batman done by michael moore political satire should be clever this however pulls a ten on the simpleton scale with all the style and credibility of an l ron hubbard film in its campy inane way it accuses the republicans of stealing elections going to war for absolutely no reason and treating servicemen and women as mere cannon fodder it even takes a swipe at the second amendment and religion all that was missing was caesar romero as the president cackling in glee about how he orchestrated 9 11 i guess the ending was supposed to be the we support our troops moment but i think they would be more offended than pleased with the entire endeavor i'm sure the hollywood elites are sitting in their malbu mansions patting each other on the backs for this pithy work while the misinformed anti war drones hail it as genius time to get fitted with new tinfoil hats kids	negative
like the characters in this show i too was a teen during the 70s the producers really nailed the whole zeitgeist of being a suburban teenager in the 70s the 70s fashions cars home furnishings foods and fads are all very authentic in this show the show boasts a very talented ensemble cast who all mesh together very well on camera i really like the unique psychedelic style film sequences no other show does camera tricks like this these cutting edge film sequences really help to convey the campy hipness that characterized the 70s era overall this is a very funny sitcom the one thing that bothers me about this show is it's over reliance on cruel humor to generate laughs in this way i think that this show tries to be too much like married with children while married with children is a great sitcom in its own right it's tacky that the creators of that 70s show keep trying to imitate it i do recommend that 70s show mainly due to it's nostalgia factor it could be an even better show though if the writers relied more on witty dialog rather than bawdy tasteless jokes and pranks	positive

enjoyed 'den brysomme mannen' http ow ly pttp my wife didn't so i watched it in bits over a few days reviewers mainly confused most agree it's allegorical but not of what 'heaven' 'hell' 'socialism' 'capitalism' that most people don't wish to escape and it's essentially forbidden goes with most of those options so presumably you're supposed to project your favourite preoccupation prejudice fear onto it so i'd say it's about an a epicurean life a live desaturated of colour literally in the film figuratively in the interpretation	positive
this film had my heart pounding the acting was great the erotic music and the beautiful women add up to make this one a winner the lead actress decides to join an escort service when she realizes that her husband has no time for her she step's into a whole new world her first client being another woman this is a film you definitely don't want to pass up	positive
i know i'm human and if you were all these things then you'd just attack me right now so some of you are still human this thing doesn't want to show itself it wants to hide inside an imitation it'll fight if it has to but it's vulnerable out in the open if it takes us over then it has no more enemies nobody left to kill it and then it's won john carpenter's the thing is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made fast clever and purely exciting from start to finish this is how all movies of the genre should be made taking place in the antarctic in 1982 the movie focuses specifically on a group of american scientists we are given no introduction to their mission but are thrust into their existence when a pair of seemingly crazy norwegians appears at their base camp chasing an escaped dog the norwegians are killed and the dog finds its way into the colony which is when things really start to get crazy it is soon made quite clear that the dog is actually a shape shifting alien organism which manifests itself upon the physical form of its victims in other words it begins to eat the americans and imitate them so well that the remaining humans cannot discern the difference between their friends and enemies the pack of scientists led by macready kurt russell begin to fight for their own survival using wits instead of brawn if the thing is indeed amongst them then how are they to go about revealing it how many things are there how can the thing be killed or can it be destroyed at all the creature's origins in the film are explained easily thirty thousand years ago a spacecraft plummeted to earth and was frozen in the antarctic ice the thing tried to escape and was discovered in the ice by the norwegians who unknowingly released it from its natural prison the thing the movie itself is similar to ridley scott's iconic alien 1979 many comparisons have been made the protagonists are stranded in a desolate area stalked by a seldom seen foe that manages to kill them off one by one however the thing for all practical purposes came first based on the famous short story who goes there by john w campbell jr writing under pseudonym as don a stuart the film was originally adapted as a feature production in 1951 by howard hawks and christian nyby the result was the thing from another world an unarguable classic but to be fair it bore little resemblance to the short story and carpenter's remake does it more justice the idea of the thing being able to adapt the physicality of anyone is what essentially makes this movie so great and is the most vital link to the short story in 1951 the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably portray the shape shifting organism but thirty one years brought many advances in sfx creature effects artist rob bottin does an excellent job of turning what could have easily become a cheesy gore fest into a startlingly frightening and realistic mess of blood and fear the thing although never actually taking one specific form is constantly seen in a morphing stage and the effects are simply superb they still pack a punch twenty two years later ennio morricone's score nominated for a razzie award at the time is a bit too electronic and tinny but nevertheless haunting when used correctly from the fact that its cast consists entirely of males to the fact that its ending is one of the most thought provoking and untypical conclusions of all time the thing by any standards is unconventional hollywood at its best it comes as no surprise that at the time of its release the thing performed poorly in theaters and e t released the same year and featuring a much kinder alien became the higher grossing picture of the two by far in the long run however the thing is superior in almost every conceivable way spielberg's tale is outdated and flopped during its 20th anniversary re release the thing on the other hand has gradually climbed a ladder of cult classics it is one of the most famous non famous movies ever made carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career from his amazing assault on precinct 13 1976 to the magnificent halloween 1978 to the disappointing and silly escape from l a 1996 the thing remains his very best motion picture although its reputation over the years has never been honorary enough to land it a spot on most great movies lists the thing is still one of my favorite horror films and upon close inspection masterfully crafted it is a daring and ingenious thrill ride that is simultaneously unique and chilling a genuine relief for film buffs who are tired of the same old horror knock offs this one at the very least is genuinely unpredictable	positive
overall this is a pretty bad film but for 5 at pathmark it wasn't a total waste the whole scenario has to do with a guy who is with this lady infected with snakes supposedly from a magic curse the actors actresses aren't names that are big even though some look like from tv shows so i won't do my usual troy mcclure thing for awhile the film holds your interest as the couple hop a train and travel to l a to see a shaman to undo the curse there's a bit of other plots going on too like two ladies smuggling drugs but the last 20 minutes turn out to be a total let down as violent and gory as the whole film is the grand finale is just totally computer animated i saw the unrated version which had tons of language gore blood violence everything the bonus features were ok overall grade d	negative

terrific acting by the 5 stars makes this one a must see based on a stage play the silver cord is about mother love at its worst the film was very controversial for its implied homosexuality of the younger son and the mother's unnatural romantic feelings for both sons irene dunne stars as the new bride and biologist who travels with husband joel mccrea to visit the family before heading off to new york city for their new jobs but something seems wrong the mother laura hope crews seems rude to the younger son's eric linden fiancée frances dee but dunne puts such thoughts aside and ignores a few of the strange things the mother says then she finds out her room is down the hall from mccrea's and his room adjoins mother's room later she walks in as mummy is tucking in mccrea and kissing him on the lips good night mummy has also been working on linden and getting him to doubt his feelings for dee everything blows up and with dee running into the snowy night toward the frozen pond as the boys run after her mummy shouts from the window for boys to come back and get their coats dee falls through the ice and is rescued as the girls leave the house the following morning dunne lets mummy know what she thinks of her and her attachment to the boys but mummy has a tight hold faking illness and forever boasting of her sacrifices the girls leave but the boys stay behind crews is magnificent as the voracious mother repeating her stage role it's a part few actresses would dare play the sexual overtones are incredible for a 1933 film and crews take advantage of her best film role dunne is also excellent as she tries to maneuver the course without losing mccrea dee has some excellent scenes after she gets dumped by bewildered linden all 5 stars are terrific in this drama that is bizarrely underrated and unknown a neglected gem for anyone who likes great acting	positive

after hoo hooing american indians scalp number one son frontiersman bruce bennett as daniel boone seems at first like he wants to get even but he really wants to make friends with the natives when sad eyed indian chief lon chaney jr as blackfish also loses number one son it gets more difficult to clear up misunderstandings apparently this was republic pictures' attempt to do for their daniel boone trail blazer what disney studio's had successfully done with davy crockett king of the wild frontier 1955 the dan'l boone song whistled and sung by a group of children in a wagon did not follow fess parker's davy crockett up the hit parade singer faron young as faron callaway doesn't perform the title song perhaps wisely he does sing long green valley and makes a good impression as a blond boyfriend for boone's daughter but spanish actor freddy fernandez is the film's most valuable player in a cute scene mr fernandez reminds mr young the name of the character susannah he is supposed to be in love with daniel boone trail blazer 10 5 56 ismael rodríguez bruce bennett lon chaney jr faron young freddy fernandez	negative
since crouching tiger hidden dragon came along there's been a lot of talk about a revival of the hong kong movie industry don't believe it the people now making movies in hk give new meaning to the word crass running out of time 2 is a perfect example ekin cheng is the name draw here but he spends most of the film just grinning idiotically and flipping a coin he flips the coin over and over and again and again why who knows sean lau plays a cop who chases after the coin flipping pretty boy but once again who knows why there's a pretty actress in the female lead who runs some sort of company and she has to pay a ransom or something but she mostly just looks like she would rather be at a spa or shopping centre than in front of a camera nothing makes any sense there is no action there is no sex there is no comedy all there is is a name ekin cheng and you know what who cares	negative
why do people who do not know what a particular time in the past was like feel the need to try to define that time for others replace woodstock with the civil war and the apollo moon landing with the titanic sinking and you've got as realistic a flick as this formulaic soap opera populated entirely by low life trash is this what kids who were too young to be allowed to go to woodstock and who failed grade school composition do i'll show those old meanies i'll put out my own movie and prove that you don't have to know nuttin about your topic to still make money yeah we already know that the one thing watching this film did for me was to give me a little insight into underclass thinking the next time i see a slut in a bar who looks like diane lane i'm running the other way it's child abuse to let parents that worthless raise kids it's audience abuse to simply stick woodstock and the moonlanding into a flick as if that ipso facto means the film portrays 1969	negative
did not know what to expect from from van damme's partner friend trainer and his fight choreographer for most of his films it was nice to see him act as tong po in kickboxer and other van damme's films now he's on his own he and his wife make a great team in this one qissi is the action director and lead bad guy and he's good really meanacing his wife was the writer producer and directed most of the scenes which didn't require action she also did good job editing the film together they did a great job the story made sense the fight scenes were edited well the leads were real fighters and looked good together the story came together well and if you can beleive it no bad language no sex just action a new one on me check it out	positive
after seeing the tv commercials for this film i marched to my local cinema expecting a lot of laughs in the end it was one of the longest 90mins i have ever spent the wog boy really did fail to provide a story line with enough substance to hold my interest and predictable and sometimes tasteless jokes didn't fill this void a scene where the two 'wog boys' dominate the dancefloor of their local nightclub was the only one that impressed me at all the only character that was worth watching was 'nathan' played by the castle's stephen curry his struggle with the opposite sex providing most of the few laughs a word for this flic is boring save yourself the time and just watch the tv commercial as the only laughs are shown on it	negative
i saw this movie when i was little it was called glacier fox i was totally traumatized by it it follows a cute little fox family around the beginning was great and i remember becoming very attached to the little foxes i also remember my mother carrying me out of the theater while i was in hysterics i won't tell you what happened but let's just say it doesn't end well for all of the foxes i was used to disney type nature films where the animals don't really die oh man this movie made me cry for hours it was a good movie i think i was really little and truth be told all i remember is being happy for the foxes and then seeing one of them die rent it if you can but don't show your kids	positive
this is a film that in no way reflects the real world nothing in this film makes any real world sense or has any real world logic it operates entirely in its own little world and your ability to accept it or not will determine your love or hate for this film i love the film somewhere at the very beginning i bought into the completely unreal premise of the hit woman regaining her memory as the past comes back to haunt her there was a moment early on where i remember accepting that this was going to be one of those movies where the heroine was going to know nothing until it was needed despite all logic that it wouldn't happen that way oh its one of those films i said to myself and was hooked as the film took off on a wild two hour chase this is an action film with brain and brawn as things follow there own internal logic and you actually have to pay attention to follow some of the twists and turns i like this a great deal and am pleasantly surprised when i bump into people who feel the same way too people either love it or hate it if they've ever heard of it at all if you like action films this is a film to definitely try you may not like it but it certainly worth the effort to find out and as always leave reality at the door	positive
this is an immoral and reprehensible piece of garbage that no doubt wants to be a friday the 13th 1980 clone the poster for this movie makes it look like there's going to be some sort of a cross between jason and freddy which is likely to attract movie goers there is nothing good or entertaining about this movie about this movie it just makes me sad just thinking that some people are going to stumble upon sleepaway camp ii unhappy campers 1988 on video or dvd and waste their time with this sad cynical depressing movie angela baker pamela springsteen is a camp counselor at camp rolling hills who hopes that the other campers are as nice as she is and that they stay out of trouble meanwhile the other campers are realizing that people are disappearing one by one with angela making up the excuse that she had to send them home could angela be the killer who was once a man who underwent a sex change operation years earlier who knows who cares the 1980s was home to a lot of movies that made the cross between the mad slasher and dead teenager genres in which a mad killer goes berserk some have a plot some don't but they're all about as bad as this one sleepaway camp ii unhappy campers is 80 minutes of teenagers being introduced and then being stabbed strangled impaled chopped up burned alive and mutilated that's all this movie is it is just mindless bloody violence watching this movie i was reminded of the friday the 13th movies in which the message for its viewers was that the primary function of teenagers is to be hacked to death the filmmakers of sleepaway camp ii have every right to be ashamed of themselves imagine the sick message that this movie offers for its teen viewers the world is a totally evil place this movie tells you and it'll kill you it doesn't matter what your dreams or your hopes are it doesn't matter if you have a new boyfriend or a new girlfriend it doesn't matter what you think what you do or what your plans for the future are you can forget those plans because you're just going to wind up dead and the sickest thing is and by not giving too much away the movie simply sets up room for a sequel well why not they've probably and already taken the bucket to the cesspool by making three or four of these movies i missed out on the original sleepaway camp 1983 and after watching its first sequel i will hopefully stay away from the other sequels as well as the original and for parents if you know kids who actually like this movie do not let them date your children	negative
for this movie based off of a tv show and a serious finale i thought that it was a lousy way to end off a serious 'm a s h goodbye farewell and amen' was pretty good but not this one unless you really love the series like myself skip this movie i was a loyal fan of the show even stevens but the plot was too gimmicky and dave coulier man that guy hasn't done anything good well ever they shouldn't have used tim meadows he's a great actor but he was too good for the script i thought the movie was pure cheese i would give it a 4 5 10	negative
seeing the cover of this before i watched it my expectations weren't high especially since it was amongst those other crappy horror movies at blockbuster alongside films like junior alright not only does this movie have the brainless stereotypical characters the rich douche bag the bitch the sheriff the localer that knows what's going wrong in the town and so forth but has such god awful dialogue acting directing and cg effects the jeremiah stone dude was hilarious spoiler i'll never understand why he bit his finger off out of nowhere when he was holding that chick up hostage the premise for the movie is just as atrocious as the other flaws from what i could get from it jeremiah stone was a gold digger during the gold rush and a notorious outlaw he had a crapload of gold spoiler and put a curse on anyone who went after his gold before he was gunned down by the locals after he killed some girl but not only did he survive he bit off his own finger and ran off so present day a group of clueless morons find out about this gold mine and of course they are warned by locals about the curse of the forty niner and what do they do as expected ignored the warnings and greedily sought for the gold they get the gold and all sorts of s t goes on thankfully spoiler the bitch gets her head cut off that's about it looking at the cover of the film you can tell what kind of movie it's going to be it's just so terrible it's hilarious 1 1 2 stars out of 5	negative
michael radford has done an excellent job bringing this difficult play to the screen he has taken a play with a reputation for anti semitism and shown us that shakespeare knew quite well the humanity of the jews radford said after the screening and i agree that shylock is his first tragic hero the first of his characters to be undone by a driving compulsive need for revenge he also points out quite rightly that a man who was anti semitic could not have written shylock's speech of if you prick me do i not bleed radford is himself of jewish descent and he has picked out the good and bad of all characters with delicacy and honesty no character is free from flaws no character is evil radford has placed the play in the 16th century which gives a lush background of venetian politics and decadence on which to project shakespeare's words if you get a chance to hear radford speak about the film i highly recommend you take it since he gives details about life in 16th century venice that illuminate a lot of the choices he made and give considerable extra depth to the viewing i'm hoping that the dvd will come out with extensive commentary jeremy irons does a gorgeous portrayal of antonio a man who resigns himself to bearing the burden of his past misdeeds lynn collins a relative unknown gives us an absolutely flawless stunning and detailed job as portia not only is ms collins beautiful she also gives portia layers of intelligence and humor prior to the trial scene i've rarely seen in any production of this play the rest of the cast also does a terrific job with a notable performance by kris marshall as gratiano and a beautifully subtle work by allan corduner as tubal playing the foil to shylock finally while al pacino pulls out his usual strong and loud performance his best moments are when the camera focuses on him and he says no words but you can see all the emotions and madnesses flowing into and out of him as he perceives his fortunes changing if you like period movies i cannot recommend this movie enough	positive
what's the point of reviewing a movie like this it's painfully and embarrassingly bad not even in a way that allows you to make fun of it movies like little man depress me they represent film at its most disposable this movie was made for a bunch of 18 24 year old dipsh t frat boys who the studio was hoping would come out and see it on opening night before word leaked out about how bad it was so that the film could quickly recoup its investment a hundred other filmmakers with great ideas probably couldn't get their films made because resources were going toward making this puddle of vomit grade f	negative
this movie should be number one on the bottom 100 the acting is so horrible that when my son and i watched it we nearly got physically ill and the story is worse i could go on and on about how bad it is but all i really wanted to do was add a warning to frankbob's review as i see no one else has gone to the trouble of doing so yet don't waste your time money energy or anything else on this movie thank goodness we saw it on tv so we didn't spend anything on it had we i would have been forced to write the people responsible for this abomination and be forced to hurl an execration in their general direction in conclusion i would like to say that i have always enjoyed watching carrie fisher act but i am sad to say that she is not worth watching in this particular film don't spoil your opinion of carrie by viewing it	negative
not that much things happen in this movie but a lot of meanings the woman thought she had all that she can in life but that was indeed not true and she found out herself when she met this person who was conducting some research for his next job there really should be more types of movies like this im not even that old as considered mature im 13 by the way and i still got the idea and point of the film the main point is in my opinion don't think you can't have a better life just because you currently have this one though i got to admit i was thinking of watching another movie but after reading all the reviews and seen the trailer i decided on this one even though i knew not that much action would appear in the film i recommend anyone to watch this movie as it has very good points in the film and is a really good ending	positive
i would of given this film a zero out of ten but i will give it a two reason one is that shah rukh khan appears in the film which is not really a reason last point is that rani appears in this film and does a smooch with kamal i love rani very much and have a respect that she is a great actress which is why i didn't enjoy her in this movie kissing kamal but its no big deal anyway enough of the bedroom scenes that made this film noticeable lets actually talk about this film is it good or bad i think its a completely rubbish movie that made me yawn me being a fantastic critic you can see my other 250 review's by clicking on my name i have great taste the movie is not entertaining is one thing and if this is suppose to be hard hitting cinema why is there no morale in this movie its a biased movie thats not a true story and it stinks watching kamal kissing these actresses makes me sick man cant kiss properly anyway	negative
this is by far the funniest sitcom that has ever aired on tv i own all 9 seasons on dvd and literally could watch them over and over anyone who does not find this show hilarious heartwarming entertaining and laugh out loud hysterical is crazy kevin james is absolutely one of the most talented comedians out there my boyfriend and i love going to stand up comedy shows in boston where we live and have seen kevin james twice and his brother gary valentine danny once they are both so unbelievably talented and just plan smart with their work there are so many comedians out there that are just awful and kevin and gary really show the true side of real comedy leah remini although a snob and bitch in real life so i have read is an amazing actress and deserves more credit than any other woman in sitcoms she truly makes the show along with jerry stiller this show is a must see and you will get addicted within one to two episodes	positive
this is probably the only movie i have ever not been able to make it all the way through not only was it annoying and boring but the low production values made it hard to make out the action and in some cases the dialogue avoid this one like the plague	negative
am i right in thinking i went to see the same film as everyone else this film was terrible i'm a fan of all 3 series of the league of gentelmen and have always respected the originality of the writers even when the format changed in series 3 this film however was a blatant half effort the plot was extremely poor having the characters going into the real world made this film see more like the last action hero there was about 5 moments in the film that got a mild chuckle but the rest of the time i was wishing it would end this would have been better as a 10 minute short on the dvd it was more of an explanation of what they planned to do and looked like some of the writers disagreed on the fate of the characters and they made a joke of this by killing him off in the first 30 minutes if your a true fan of the league of gentlemens ability to stay fresh then you'll hate this film if you only watch it cause there was nothing better on tv then u'll love it someone back me up	negative
emory is a cincinatti steel worker like his father before him and for most of the 20th century the twin pillars of his family's existence have been the steel mill and the union the mill which once employed 45 000 has seen its numbers dwindle to 5 000 recently and now 1 as the plant just shut its doors leaving a single security guard at first newly unemployed emory and his pals enjoy their independence hanging out around town and carousing at their favorite bar where they down depth charges with reckless abandon they think the mill will reopen after listening to their union rep's optimistic spiel but reality starts to sink in when they find themselves selling their personal vehicles in a struggle to put food on the table and stave off foreclosure of their homes emory's father a dedicated union man is sure the plant will reopen and recalls for his son all the short lived closures during his own 35 years at the mill meanwhile some of the unemployed men take demeaning make work jobs or hop in their trucks and take off in a desperate search for employment finally the union admits its helplessness as emory explains to his stubborn father that times have changed and that the mill won't ever open again emory tearfully asks what did i do wrong as a lifetime of hard work and devotion to job union church and family have left him with nothing and nowhere to turn he hits rock bottom when in a drunken rage he manhandles his young sons and knocks his wife to the floor tossed out of his own home and stinging from the plant manager's comments that he and his men didn't work hard enough to justify their substantial paychecks emory recruits the steel workers still left in town to do something that will demonstrate to all what they are capable of early in the morning they break into the mill fire up the furnaces and work harder than they ever have in their lives producing in one shift enough high quality steel pipes to fill the loading docks from wall to wall top to bottom something the plant manager thought was impossible arriving at the suddenly reopened plant the stupefied manager looks around him at the tremendous output that came from a single day's work realizing that production like this could make the plant profitable again the manager asks emory can you do this every day emory is forced to nod no and the manager asks then what were you trying to prove emory explains that the workers' decades of hard work honesty and devotion to their jobs had meaning and that by showing how much they could produce in one day we just spit in your eye emory bids a tearful farewell to his wife and kids as he takes off with his buddies to look for work down south promising to relocate the family when he finds it this is a powerful and honest treatment of the plight of american workers displaced by foreign competition and gives a realistic view of the costs they bear for the short sightedness of concession demanding unions and greedy plant owners who extracted every penny they could from their factories but never gave back by modernizing them peter strauss as emory john goodman as his best friend gary cole as his college boy brother pamela reed as emory's sympathetic wife and john doucette as his dying father all turn in excellent performances in this fine picture	positive

gregory peck's brilliant portrayal of douglas macarthur from the battle of corregidor in the philippines at the start of the pacific war largely through to his removal as un commander during the korean war offers reason to believe all three of the above possibilities certainly the most controversial american general of the second world war and possibly ever macarthur is presented here as a man of massive contradictions he claims that soldiers above all yearn for peace yet he obviously glories in war he consistently denies any political ambitions yet almost everything he does is deliberately used to boost himself as a presidential candidate he obviously believes that soldiers under his command have to follow his orders to the letter yet he himself deliberately defies orders from the president of the united states he shows great respect for other cultures particularly in the philippines and japan and yet is completely out of touch with his own country all these things are held in balance throughout this movie and in the end the viewer is left to draw his or her own conclusions about the man although one is left with no doubt that macarthur sincerely and passionately loved his country and especially the army he devoted his life to peck's performance was as i said brilliant to the point actually of overshadowing virtually everyone else in the film which is perhaps appropriate given who he was portraying with the possible exception of ed flanders i though he offered a compelling look at harry truman and his attitude to macarthur sarcastic repeatedly referring to macarthur as his majesty angry frustrated and finally completely fed up with this general who simply won't respect his authority as president marj dusay was also intriguing as macarhur's wife jean devoted to her husband whom she herself referred to as general although their relationship seems to have been a happy enough one i very much enjoyed this movie although perhaps would have liked to have learned a little more about macarthur's early life i have always chuckled at macarthur's reaction to eisenhower being elected president he'll make a fine president he was the best damn clerk i ever had which seems to sum up what macarthur thought the role of the president should be especially to his military commanders during wartime well worth watching 8 10	positive
spoilers to understand what really happened first you have to be a warrior to stay alive in real war to think off line analytically critically and not linear otherwise you will come to false conclusions that maj gray was dumb or unstable person truth is something completely different he was firm hardened veteran and only way he could be killed by capt o'malley is that he wants her to kill him it was his way out he choose it he was not man who will retire if you've never been on a first line you can't understand it he intentionally prepare his own suicide first he seduced mary jane than intentionally acted as a dumb than stageed argue shutting incident before witnesses to protect her later after she done what he wants her to do if it comes to trial than gave her son a bullets to assure he could load her gun later came that night loaded her gun woke her up put her gun in her hands acted as he was attacking her after shot first time he raised knife and cried one kill so she shot him again and before died he put knife off like he was trying to took him back again after first shot he also gave her a message with his last cry after first kill everything will change inside your mind and destroy your life this is the the only way for me to die as a man yet to be killed by somebody i love is my choice and my only prerogative war and army is not what you thought so far grow up finally and save your life till you can she left military life at the end she did understand him and he did not die in vain the man who helped him to prepare all that and after to carry out the trial and the outcome of that trial was col sam doran with help of lt tim macy macy didn't know what is really going on and what will be the outcome but did what he was expected to do he took photos of mary jane and maj gray by order of col sam doran who gave that order because maj gray asked him to do that after she refused to leave army what col doran asked her to do col doran convinced prosecutor to charge her with a premeditated murder he knew she cant be found quilty instead of manslaughter there was some possibility to be found quilty with taken photos col doran also suppress argue shutting incident to escalate to prevent prosecutor to have any doubt about premeditated murder charge but let it be revealed during the trial what greatly influenced the jury i have no doubt about outcome of that trial why col doran did that way because he will do anything maj gray ask him to do why because he saved his life on a battlefield why mary jane choose to go to trial because she was a person who have integrity a principles and that is why maj gray choose her it has to be somebody deserving somebody honourable keeping his secret about what really happened that night she also prove her honour miroslav	positive
although flatliners is 15 years old tonight was my first time ever seeing it i had heard about the movie flatliners but there was never a buzz about it to make me go out and rent it or make a point to see it period well i caught it on one of the premium channels and i must say that it was very good this movie was about some brilliant young medical students deciding to explore death they have figured out a way to cause a person to die briefly and bring him her back to life besides the all star cast this movie had some serious bite to it just the very thought of exploring death is riveting enough but i really thought the writer director did an excellent job in giving a different yet hair raising view this was no generic attempt to thrill frighten and make one's mind race this was the real deal instead of making it an empty superficial star studded thriller this movie had substance a nail biter white knuckle edge of the seat hard nose thriller i give it an 8 10	positive
i read about this movie in a magazine and i was intrigued a woman who one day sees herself drive past in her own car well i thought this could be interesting but it isn't first the title the broken the broken what what is broken the oh wait i get it the title itself is broken wow clever unfortunately this is virtually the only thing going for it the premise is not that bad but i think kiefer suderland did much better in 'mirrors' a cross between invasion of the body snatchers and mirrors and a rather mediocre one at that a more suited title would be 'the boring' since it draws out every single scene for bloody ages or maybe 'the confusing' since it doesn't explain anything at all not in the narrative nor in the story itself only some vague idea about evil copies and somesuch dotted with cheap scares and scenes used to death but nothing tangible it's just messed up on the other hand the acting and the special effects are quite good but then again it's not a difficult role to act after watching the movie twice i still feel unsatisfied a little confused maybe and not in the e a poe or stephen king kind of way do yourself a favor and don't watch this one simply put there are better thrillers out there	negative
this film follows a very similar storyboard to the warriors only with less intensity and rather poor acting which is nothing to write home about the story in general is not that bad based around a small aussie gang who are trying to get out of the city when one of their members is framed for the rape of another gang's girl they then have to fight their way through the streets whilst they are been hunted down by a number of rival gangs on could assume that the writers have taken a page out of the warriors book and re written it but as mentioned above with not nearly as much intensity the acting as a whole is not very good in my opinion and it's clearly obvious on many occasions that they are indeed acting the fight scenes make up for this however but then the poor sound effects that go with them bring it back down this film has nothing on once were warriors low budget alright story poor acting nothing to write home about	negative
i found this movie on one of my old videos after godzilla vs the sea monster which should instantly give you an idea of it's tone and i hadn't seen it in a while so i decided to watch it i didn't remember much about rainbow brite except i used to like the cartoon and that it was cute most people feel that way about her you probably do to well when the movie started i wondered if it was the right one it didn't fit the mold of rainbow brite as i remembered her but it turns out she kicks butt this has to be the strangest animated movie ever i can't believe these characters were so popular the series isn't much different while being so bizzare as soon as i watched this movie again it became one of my favorites i really don't want to give too much away just know that if you see the movie in the video store rent it and watch it no questions asked you will get a kick out of it especially the outrageous princess character and the robotic horse and the hypnotized sprites if you can't tell by know this is an 80's cartoon that is really an undiscovered head movie in disguise have fun	positive
i viewed the movie together with a homophobic friend my wife and her female friend so i had views from all kinds of directions mainly the film made me laugh the sexual tension was not really there and the only noticeable actors were tudor chirila and maria popistasu yes i do think she played her role well even if the script was not appropriate there were good romanian actors around they just didn't have complex roles i applaud puya's entering the movie business i don't know why but i think he's a good guy i just hope he'll be a good actor the wife loved the movie though and i think there might have been chords being played and to which i had no ear for if the film tried to present uncommon sexual behaviors and their consequences in todays romania then it failed miserably there were no consequences just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl and the same story becomes just a boring uninteresting plot i have no idea why it got all those bafta awards in my book it should have gotten the better luck next time award bafta good luck in romanian	positive
this was longer than the ten commandments all lord of the rings and the matrix trilogy combined my oh my what a nightmare this is the single biggest over hype of 2006 there is not a moment that is not scripted and clichéd movie musicals can be done brilliantly and bring genuine excitement to the viewer dreamgirls takes the route of chinese water torture in the form of endless music montages shoddy acting and poor directing choices seriously mr condon did you have to do the old billboard countdown shots it's at 58 no wait look its rising up the charts and here is the passing billboard notice to show you again and again and again	negative
the only reason i saw this movie was for jimmy fallon who i've had a crush on since 9th grade which was his first year on snl i am a die hard yankees fan and i didn't find the movie painful until the last 15 minutes when they begin showing clips of the alcs games i had to cover my ears and make small noises so i wouldn't have to hear that which must not be heard but otherwise it was completely bearable i thought jimmy played the role very well because the character was supposed to be nervous and quirky and he is a nervous and quirky guy i know that it may not be a academy award winning stretch but the movie is just a light fun romantic comedy that is actually appropriate for both women and men to see jimmy and drew worked well together and they had much better chemistry on camera than other actors in the past ed burns and angelina jolie in that stupid movie what i think jimmy has a positive career ahead of him and thank goodness because taxi could have killed it i think fever pitch will help him out a lot everyone needs to stop being so critical of his acting ability because he is just starting out in movies i imagine it must be difficult and if you look at any of the other great actors of our time tom hanks russell crowe etc you'll see that they started off in some flops busom buddies australian soap operas here's wishing jimmy a successful career on screen i never wanted him to leave snl but what can you do	positive
let's be fair there are no rules for scriptwriting so i won't say the movie should be something other than it is i'll just state my opinion ok i really liked the script the way things are told and characters are introduced however i think when a play is adapted to the silver screen it could maybe try and fit this other media since this movie was directed by joão falcão the same man who directed the play it's not too much of a surprise that the film turned out a bit too theatrical it's the man's first movie for cryin' out loud what i'm saying is there are parts in the film like the city of nordestina which slightly resembles the set of hoje é dia de maria that feel like we're not at a movie theater we're at the theater lines are spoken too formally characters are moving choreographically and the lightening is clearly meant for a stage sure maybe that was the intention but that's been done on stage wonderful things have been made when adapting a play into a movie the beautiful closer for instance when i went to see this one though i didn't feel like i was watching a movie but overall it was a good one worth watching it's a nice love story funny at times and sad at others my vote is a 7	positive
i must admit i was one of the skeptics who prematurely judged this show before relatively any information was disseminated about it i determined that it was going to be a cheap spin off guided by ronald d moore wielding the retcon wand i was wrong the pilot leaves an excellent impression upon the viewers the accessibility is marvelous of course seasoned bsg veterans will find themselves immersed in the plot which is focused on the development of the cylons before the first war 58 years before the events of the bsg pilot the pilot also allows for newcomers clearly presenting its plot and ideas in the first part of the episode don't be mistaken caprica is not bsg we are presented with an immersive cerebral drama dotted by provocative daring and controversial ideas the casting maintains bsg's standards stoltz and morales are simply astounding morales' portrayal of joseph adama inspired by olmos' portrayal of william gives a wonderful glimpse of william's heroic father stoltz's portrayal of dr graystone provokes a lot of thinking and questions if the quality of the pilot is any indication of what's yet to come rdm and the creative team are set to continue bsg's legacy of first rate television programming with another masterfully created television masterpiece	positive
i've always said that there's nothing to beat the original form the comics i've been proved right again this like all of the other movie takes on the asterix series failed to impress the makers of this movie don't get it that what makes all the other such comic turned movies x men superman et al ventures successful is that they all deviate from the original comic versions and adapt it to make it more watchable agreed this movie did deviate in the sense that this movie was a cross of two asterix books viz asterix and the great crossing asterix and the normans also uncharacteristic of the asterix series save asterix and the secret weapon a love interest for one of the main characters was introduced all this ended up doing was create a childishly immature storyline the funny parts were very few and far between all in all a total waste of time and money watching this let alone at theaters even at home	negative
your idol will deceive you in this movie stephen nichols is mis cast as a young german student still bending under his father's orders although the actor obviously looks near 40 years old this makes his relationship a collection of copulation scenes basically to a very young looking girl all the more disturbing the character's have no dimension and the war depiction serves only as a backdrop for this soft porn wannabe nichols who is one of daytime tv's best performers shows no passion in what is to be the main interest of this movie watching him have sex over and over with this girl it's like watching two animals going at it if you're a fan of this actor's talent in other projects don't rent this for you will never view him in the same way if on the other hand you want to see stephen nichols have an orgasm in front of the camera you might like it stephen will show you his naked butt lots of tongue work his groaning range but not his talent as this character who's obviously just as sex driven and misjudging as he was for wanting to do such personal things in front of the camera he may have found it kinky but i didn't a big deception	negative
after tracking it down for half a year i finally found a copy and it was not disappointing not disappointing because i'm one of those die hard smap fans who need to see all their works and i finally got to see the so called hot film of goro but i couldn't believe goro was forced to make a movie as such in his respectable self now i'm sure he cringes that he made this movie nevertheless they found the perfect person for looking embarrassed ill at ease and half depressed most of the time man i still can't believe he made this movie i had to cover my eyes at many parts not believing he really made such a movie hahahaha but i'm glad to have watched it thank goodness he has grown up	positive
for the people who have compared this trash to the brilliance of david lynch etc please listen to your carer when they say dont use other people's pc without their permission this is complete and utter poo there is no art here this is some person trying to make a name for himself with a cluster of gross out ideas which he was not clever enough to enforce into one main idea so instead he went for the easy option any one with half a brain could sit at home and conjure up some controversial images to shock viewers but it takes a person with true imagination to be able to make it into a movie people want to watch i am a lover of shock cinema i have seen or own pretty much all you can get and i can strongly advise to anyone who loves the world of movies to steer well clear of this garbage this one is only for people who like to over analyze what they are watching or for the 17 year old first time drinkers who dont know any better 0 10	negative

comedies often have the unfortunate reputation of having little real depth arms and the man proves that notion to be false shaw's play is full of comedic drama combining an entertaining plot with true philosophical depth on one level arms and the man is a successful and somewhat unique romantic comedy the young melodramatic and superficial raina comes from a military family deeply involved in a war her fiancé and her father are both military officers she is shocked one night by the arrival of an enemy soldier she rescues him knowing that she'll have to keep the incident a secret from her family forever and the soldier eventually leaves of course once the war is over that soldier comes back forcing each of the primary characters to reevaluate their values and their relationships it is quite interesting how shaw layers meaning within the rather standard comedic plot shaw manages to comment on class constructs on the absurdity of war and even on the nature of love and of course he does this with the shavian wit and within a satisfying plot there is so much here to think about that i think a lot can be missed in a single viewing arms and the man is excellent comedic theater and is definitely one of shaw's best works arms and the man is both an amusing and thought provoking movie that retains its relevance even today more than a century after it was first conceived shaw mocks at the popular theories on war and love and combines a military satire with a taunt on love and family structure the play has flashing wit buoyant humor and bitter sarcasms a good example of shaw's dialog is the statement by captain bluntschli to serguis i'm a professional soldier i fight when i have to and am very glad to get out of it when i haven't to you're only an amateur you think fighting is an amusement indeed as a swiss hotel keeper's son bluntschli had no reason to be involved in war and it is in this absurdity that shaw questions patriotic sentiments shaw explores the whole concept of war and the military from both sides of the struggle and in the end shows that the feelings in both camps are not that different the dialog and sarcasm used towards the common notions of life are entangled with a gentle assurance of the movement of the story towards a fairytale ending the end where all characters are rendered happy and lovers change and love shifts is what underlines the essence of this drama as a comedy this is a movie that sustains its image of possessing a universal appeal and is still appropriate today when the concepts of war and patriotism and love and marriage have changed dramatically shaw's arms and the man should maintain its relevance as long as there is love and war	positive
after his success with a nightmare on elm street in 1984 director wes craven for some reason decided that his next project would be this tv movie i'm not a big fan of this director on the whole early exploitation flick the last house on the left as well as his modern slasher scream sit well with me but the rest of his work is very hit and miss and i'd hesitate to call him the master that others have labelled him as the main theme here is cryogenic freezing although it's more a springboard for the plot rather than an important part of the movie the main influence here is obviously the excellent 1974 zombie film deathdream and we focus on miles creighton a businessman cryogenically frozen for ten years before an accident that means he has to be thawed out immediately miles is a part of a project for people that are ill they pay to be frozen in the hope that they will be revived in the future when their illnesses can cured miles is successfully revived and it's seen as a miracle but the person that wakes up is not the person who was frozen as miles returns without a soul this film could actually have been quite decent judging by the idea behind it but instead we're given a plot that doesn't really have a lot to it and it has to be said that craven doesn't make the best out of the potential of the film the 'soul' is the main focal point but it would seem that not having a soul and simply having a murderous intent no compassion are the same thing which feels a bit unimaginative the film was made for television so it's not particularly nasty and it's obvious that not a lot of money was spent on it as the whole production feels very cheap michael beck never became a very popular actor and that isn't surprising judging by his performance here while he is passable he largely lacks charisma and is not formidable in the central role the plot doesn't flow too badly but there's a real lack of suspense and or tension and things slow down too much too often which results in the film being rather boring on occasion it all boils down to a predictable ending also overall i have to admit that i was not impressed at all by this film and as far as craven's filmography goes chiller would have to go down with shocker the scream sequels and the hills have eyes ii as a miss	negative
in the same tune as his americana drums along the mohawk john ford captures american history in a way that is fictional yet very believable henry fonda made three consecutive films in this era with ford and all three are about a certain time and place with emphasis on the setting and the cultural surroundings in mohawk pioneer america is in full bloom with americans fending for themselves against indians and other forces here ford shows us 19th century america a time when invention and creativity were beginning to blossom and this nation truly was becoming great amongst it all was a tall lanky young lawyer from illinois named abe lincoln and this film fictionalizes his life as a lawyer foreshadowing the greatness he would later accomplish fonda is superb in this movie capturing the essence of what is considered to be the persona of lincoln although no one knows exactly what he was like then the sets and supporting cast also work well together and give a unique balance in ford's picturesque of the american dream and its many forms this is not a film to be taken literally but rather symbolically showing that lincoln was indeed warming up for the events in his life that were to creates his legacy we even get some scenes between him and a young mary todd and it is hard to see how they did end up together but that is not the point i believe this is simply a tribute to the greatness of lincoln widely regarded as the greatest american president his quiet and straightforward demeanor was rare then and would be today indeed our government surely needs more men like him	positive
i saw this at a screening last night too i was totally blown away at how much better this movie was than what i expected not many movies can combine dark comedy and current event drama and not have it fall apart in the conclusion i won't bother rehashing the plot too much because i think the less you know about this movie going into it makes it that much better but i will say that adam sandler's performance was really refreshing and real he was funny and much funnier than most of his most recent comedies don cheadle was believable as always this movie isn't funny like borat or billy madison but it has a good pace about it i'd say 90 of the audience laughed for most of the film midway through the movie slows down to address the drama end of things and does a really nice job of tying it all together i also thought it was really cool how instead of playing up the whole black friend white friend thing they chose to just ignore it and focus on the relationships themselves	positive
spoilers this is one bad movie seriously acting in absolutely horrible the fx are dreadfull and the plot is down right awful but hey its so bad that its fun watching the script is so bad that its enjoyable you just have to cringe and laugh at lines such as i guess thats what you call crocteasing as the women flash their breasts at the crocodile i mean come on thats funny cause its so bad it has such horrible jokes that they're funny but after a while it just becomes to much as the movie turns into crap i really started to fall asleep trust me though the plastic croc foot stamping on the leaves and the constant swishes of a crock tail well keep you laughing for a long time though i have to say it had one cool part when the croc ripped that dude in half and he just hung there for a while figuring out what to do heh heh mindless movie which has to be nominated for the mst3k line	negative
for some unknown reason 7 years ago i watched this movie with my mother and sister i don't think i've ever laughed as hard with them before this movie was sooooo bad how sequels were produced is beyond me its been awhile since i last saw this movie but the one impression that it has stuck with me over the years has been they must have found the script in a dumpster in the backlot of a cheap movie studio made into a movie and decided that it didn't suck enough and made it worse i'm pretty sure that they spent all the budget on camera work and the so called special effects and then had 13 cents left toward the script and to pay the actors	negative
terrible movie nuff said these lines are just filler the movie was bad why i have to expand on that i don't know this is already a waste of my time i just wanted to warn others avoid this movie the acting sucks and the writing is just moronic bad in every way the only nice thing about the movie are deniz akkaya's breasts even that was ruined though by a terrible and unneeded rape scene the movie is a poorly contrived and totally unbelievable piece of garbage ok now i am just going to rag on imdb for this stupid rule of 10 lines of text minimum first i waste my time watching this offal then feeling compelled to warn others i create an account with imdb only to discover that i have to write a friggen essay on the film just to express how bad i think it is totally unnecessary	negative
did i step in something or is that bad smell coming from daybreak 1 2 god was behind everything what has god got to do with sci fi god is only the answer when you can't think up a sensible explanation for something in fact this is exactly the problem with the series finale they obviously couldn't think up sensible explanations for the multitude of big questions that were raised throughout the series such as how kara thrace come back from the dead in a brand new viper how her old viper and charred body ended up on earth 2 why baltar has an imaginary 6 in his head why 6 has an imaginary baltar in her head etc so they explain it with angels or just don't explain it at all the plot of the last 2 episodes had holes big enough to fly a basestar through for example why does galactica and its crew go on a suicide mission to rescue one girl hera particularly after adama said there was no way he'd attempt a rescue because they found out the location of the cylon base that's not a good reason to sacrifice the crew's lives and how did anders know the location and what was the point of the flashbacks to the major characters' lives before the war it's like they forgot to do it earlier so they threw something in at the last moment the people who wrote the last two episodes could not have been the same writers who created what has been so far a sensational series feels like the script writing was take over by evangelical christians on a mission to spread 'the word' forget trying to tie up the loose ends in the plot the important message the writers wanted to get across is don't put your faith in technology as it will lead to your destruction god is your ultimate salvation tough luck if you have an illness that needs medical treatment imagine in the final movie of the star wars series they tell you there is no force instead a jedi actually gets his power from jesus then they fly their spaceships into the nearest star and go live in the forest with the ewoks would this be a good ending no it frakken' wouldn't	negative
i started watching this because i was looking for a nice 'background' comedy for my sunday morning then i noticed that this was going to be a road movie and i decided to actually watch this first 15 minutes were awful but i wanted to give this a chance because i never judge a movie without watching it throughly then things started to get little better this seemed like a nice road movie about friendship but then the movie started to get horrible predictable cliché twists and when the movie was over it left you feeling like you had wasted your time did this have anything to say why did they even make a movie like this and i wasn't expecting a modern citizen kane but still i have several ideas how this movie could have been improved so take my piece of advice leave this alone and go watch a real road movie there are many of those i won't make the directors of those movies seem bad by putting their names on this review 1 10	negative
i first saw this movie as a teenager when it came out in theaters way back when seeing it again nearly 30 years later i was surprised at how well it has held up the gags are still funny the interaction between characters works great and the cameos come off better than ever steve martin's has to be the best one my kids 9 11 and 14 all loved it and the music is good enough that they are still humming the tunes many days later i would suggest that before seeing the movie you should view at least a half dozen episodes of the muppet show to get a sense of the back story behind the characters otherwise the movie won't make all that much sense	positive
i saw this series on pbs in 1980 in college and i still can't get it out of my head although i have never seen it since i remember every cast member the casting was perfect as mentioned in other comments the design the lighting and of course the story which is by itself is enough to keep you glued to the set probably the best tv series i ever saw next to the original roots	positive

there have been many movies featuring bigfoot the majority of which are not good but most at least have a goofy charm to them sasquatch hunters doesn't even have that going for it it's just a crashing bore sasquatch hunters is about a group of paleontologists primatologists and forest rangers that venture off into a remote part of a pacific northwest forest bones belonging to some sort of abnormally large primate have been discovered in this region and since apes aren't natural to north america to begin with this leads to a scientific expedition sure enough they soon discover a whole burial ground full of the skeletal remains of these enormous ape like creatures i think we all know what happens to people that disturb ancient burial grounds in the movies the first half of the movie consists of uninteresting interchangeable characters assembling their gear hiking through the woods stopping to rest hiking through the woods some more pausing long enough to investigate and discuss a few findings along the way yet more hiking through the woods looking for a group member that has vanished even more hiking through the woods digging through dirt random theorizing and gathering around a campfire to discuss what little they've done that day when sasquatch finally shows up it just turns into people stumbling around in the dark while being picked off one at a time done in a blink and you missed it fashion and the actual killing occurs off camera all of this is excruciatingly boring the movie wants to be taken seriously and the director is clearly trying to build suspense but there is none to be found thus we are left with dull drawn out scenes of people wandering around the woods just to get somewhere and wander around the woods at night trying to act scared i'd be lying if i said i didn't make liberal use of the fast forward button to speed these scenes up as for sasquatch himself much like every other character else in the movie it doesn't have much to do and lacks a distinct personality it looks like a shaggier version of king kong which isn't all that bad except in the scenes where they used cgi instead of a man in a bigfoot costume which is painfully obvious during the daylight monster scenes a part of me can't help but feel that even using computer effects to bring bigfoot to life is a tad sacrilegious if there is any single movie monster that i believe should only be brought to life through situation it's bigfoot this is one of those movies that doesn't so much have a plot as it does a premise that's all it really is a premise which the people involved stretched out to make a feature length motion picture without bothering to add all the ingredients to make a worthwhile movie	negative
billy wilder continues his strong run of films during the 1950s with a biopic of charles lindbergh the young american pilot who became the first man to fly solo across the atlantic in 1927 jimmy stewart plays lindbergh and while he might be a bit too old for the part he still brings the sincere warmth and confidence needed as well as his trademark down to earth goodness that makes him an iconic film star wilder directs solidly balancing the background story with humor and drama to give us a clear description of what lindbergh was up against when he decided to take this challenge it certainly isn't his nor stewart's best work but it is a gem of a movie it lifts your spirits with the plane and makes you proud to be an american overall it is just plain good	positive
i saw this in the market place at the cannes film festival it's a real cheapo prod nothing wrong with that but you have to make up for it with a bit of sex or gore or both think larry cohen sean young is an interesting actor well done to the producers for hooking her i guess the opening scene in the space ship coming down is hilarious you could picture all the crew hands shaking it around ha ha but i wish the people who made this well at least it's not pretentious	negative
nick millard aka nick phillips should have left well enough alone when he made criminally insane 10 years before the release of this god awful waste of time and effort the fact that the original criminally insane was less than an hour in length should have clued him into the fact that he had probably milked this storyline for all he was going to get out of it but instead he opts to use tons of footage from the original in this one as well even to the point of recycling the original opening credit sequence unfortunately bringing back the rapidly aging priscilla alden did not save this one what little bit of original footage there was in this flick looks as if it were filmed with a rented hand held camcorder if this film cost more than 100 to make i would be very surprised and i would be equally surprised if it made anything close to that amount avoid this one and watch the original instead	negative
i really liked this movie one thing i have noticed is that korean tv drama's are way better as far as giving you the whole story i watch movies when i do not have the time or feel like going through 16 30 episodes movies are seem to be rushed and if you do not watch carefully you may miss something i do feel this one was rushed and i had to rewind a few parts to try and find what i missed especially towards at the end if you like nice love stories i still think this is cute and if yo have the extra time i still think this is worth watching it is always nice to go back follow the actors in different movies as we do not get to follow them from when they begin as we do the actors producers and directors in our own countries	positive
tim robbins is oddly benign here cast as a garage mechanic in 1950s new jersey who falls in love with a perky blonde who turns out to be albert einstein's niece although he's on screen much of the time robbins cancels out the inner workings of his intense persona and fades into the background it's easy to forget he's even in the picture lumpy romantic comedy with a gimmick that being walter matthau playing einstein who does what he can with a cartoonishly conceived character otherwise it's sugary and sunny directed rather drowsily by fred schepisi who shows heart but no wit or brains meg ryan is her usual affable self and the chemistry between she and robbins is charming like that of an affectionate sister and her big brother from	negative
picking up right after the moscow showdown of supremacy this is bourne's greatest adventure and his final climax throughout the tight 115 min runtime the movie takes bourne from russia to madrid paris marocco and ultimately new york damon is every inch of the hard trained killer robert ludlum imagined he is the most deadly spy in the movies right now and it's the underpinned emotions to his character that makes him so believable and it's exactly the fine way damon manages to combine these two polar opposites of himself that's so breathtaking in this third bourne is on a mission to save his soul and while watching it ultimatum delivers such an high octane performance that you'll find yourself sweating and gasping over its truly powerful branch of ideas and pull offs just look out for two great car chases and a fight scene as realistic as bond vs shaw back in '63 director greengrass has surpassed himself with this compelling thriller and this is probably as exciting as cinema thrillers get a true pay off to bourne fans and a new breed of spy thriller standard	positive
kairo or pulse as it's known amongst english speaking audiences is set in tokyo starts as sunny plant sales employee michi kudo kumiko aso decides to visit her friend taguchi kenji mizuhashi to enquire about a computer disk he's been working on when she gets to his place he gives her the disk but then rather inconsiderately commits suicide in front of her meanwhile a student named ryosuke kawashima haruhiko kato has recently hooked up to the internet keeps getting spooky messages images on his monitor so he ask's computer whizz harue karasawa koyuki whats happening she doesn't really know but it seems that the place where people's spirits go when they die is full they need somewhere else to go earth is as good a place as any right these spirits don't like sharing either so they sort of make people commit suicide or turn them into ashes or something like that i don't really know because the films a bit of a mess this japanese production was written directed by kiyoshi kurosawa right off the bat i have to say i hated kairo i hated everything about it it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that asian cinema can produce something as crap as any american filmmaker the script is an overlong mess the thing simply doesn't make any sense with scenes which seem like they are from a different film sequences which make no logical sense or are not explained in any way kairo is also the most downright boring film i've sat through this year at two hours long this is a real chore to sit through i really wanted to fast forward it but i'm fair if nothing else so i stuck it out to the bitter end frankly wished i hadn't there are so many things wrong with kairo i suppose the filmmakers were going for a surreal ambiguous deliberately incoherent feel but those are traits which i despise in a film unless they are done properly then there's the whole internet thing which i just couldn't relate to at all i use the internet all day it's not in the least bit scary to me in any way then there's the fact that kairo as a film provided zero entertainment value for me maybe i'm a neanderthal but i kind of like the films i watch to entertain me make some sort of sense not bore me to death director kurosawa has made the ultimate insomnia cure as far as i'm concerned if you have trouble getting to sleep stick this in the dvd you be fast asleep within 10 minutes i guarantee you i didn't think kairo was scary in the slightest the whole internet thing was laughable as for scary you should see some of the penis enlargement pop up ads i get now that's scary i hate this film i hate this film i'm sorry i just need to make that basic point again twice forget about any action tension or gore as there isn't any if you have a very nervous disposition then there are maybe a couple of scenes which might creep you out otherwise this is kiddie friendly pg rated stuff all the way urgh the film looks so dull boring it's untrue the camera just sits there for very long shots when it does move it moves very slowly this has all the style of a mexican soap opera since kairo is sub titled it's difficult to judge the original performances so i won't bother it's hard to care for someone when they don't even speak the same language you don't know what they are saying kairo is crap i hated it it's as simple straight forward as that just because it's an asian flick doesn't automatically make it any good the mess of a story the plot holes the fact it makes no sense it's an absolute bore means kairo would rightly be torn to shreds by people if it were an american production the worst film i've seen this year by some distance kairo got a hollywood remake as pulse 2006	negative

to be honest at the time i first heard of this show i though it may be a bad idea to make a show that makes muslims use racial jokes on themselves but it is the exact opposite i realized that the show doing that can help people understand that if a muslim uses s a word like this in real life it doesn't mean it is a terrorist thing it also show's how people give the muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype by watching the show regular people will realize that all though there may be bad muslims out it doesn't mean we are all bad we just try to live 1 day at a time like how hard it was for amair to get on a plane and how he used words like blow up or yaser saying we'll blow away the competition and people took it the wrong way being a muslim i know that stuff like this don't usually happen but they do and many people think bad things about muslims or afghanistan or iraq its not right things are not like that people will see how we are poorly treated by watching this show and it may make them think on how the act i am glad a show like this came on the air there are many shows that piotr muslim people as terrorists many people do find them funny to my opioion it is ok to do it now and then because prety much everything is made fun of who are we to say you can not make fun of that is unfair but it is done to often and really gives muslin people a bad name	negative
i think the deal with this movie is that it has about 2 minutes of really really funny moments and it makes a very good trailer and a lot of people came in with expectations from the trailer and this time the movie doesn't live up to the trailer it's a little more sluggish and drags a little slowly for such an exciting premise and i think i'm seeing from the comments people having a love hate relationship with this movie however if you look at this movie for what it is and not what it could have been considering the talent of the cast i think it's still pretty good julia stiles is clearly the star she's so giddy and carefree that set among the conformity of everyone else she just glows and the whole audience falls in love with her along with lee the rest of the cast of course lee's testosterone filled coworkers his elegant mother in law his fratlike friend jim and his bride to be all do an excellent job of fitting into stereotypes of conformity and boringness that make stiles stand out in the first place lee doesn't live up to his costars i don't think but you could view that as more that they're hard to live up to maybe that's one source of disappointment the movie itself despite a bit of slowness and a few jokes that don't come off as funny as the writer's intended is still pretty funny and i found a rather intelligent film the themes of conformity and taking the safe route seemed to cleverly align on several layers for example there was the whole motif of how he would imagine scenarios but would never act on them until the last scene or how he was listening to a radio program on the highway talking about how everyone conforms or just how everything selma blair and julia stiles' characters said and did was echoed by those themes of one person being the safe choice and one being the risky choice the other good thing about the movie was that it was kind of a screwball comedy in which jason lee has to keep lying his way through the movie and who through dumb luck example the pharmacy guy turning out to be a good chef and some cleverness on his part gets away with it for the most part while it wasn't as funny as i expected and there was a little bit of squandered talent but overall it's still a good movie	positive
the 1930s saw a vogue for documentary films about remote corners of the world with an emphasis on wild animals exotic terrain and primitive people with unusual cultures despite the logistics of transporting a film crew to a distant and dangerous place and then bringing 'em back alive with the film footage such films were often much cheaper to make than were conventional hollywood features because there were no expensive sets costumes or high priced movie stars the most successful makers of such films artistically and financially were the team of martin e johnson and his wife osa who made several documentaries sometimes with blatantly staged events in africa and asia the johnsons' safari films were extremely popular inspiring several parodies most notably wheeler woolsey's so this is africa in which the very sexy esther muir plays a character named mrs johnson martini instead of martin e johnson geddit although several other filmmakers were producing safari documentaries at this time the johnsons' films were the most popular in this genre because they relied heavily on humour viewed from our own more enlightened i hope standpoint this is a serious flaw in the johnsons' documentaries there are too many scenes in which the funny little brown or yellow people are made to look complete idiots who are easily outsmarted by the clever white bwana johnson and his wife one definite asset of these movies is the presence of osa johnson ten years younger than her husband she manages to seem young enough to be his daughter while certainly not as attractive as the shapely blond esther muir osa johnson was a pert brunette who gave ingratiating performances in front of the camera in all the films she co produced with her husband 'congorilla' is probably the best of the johnsons' films the shots of the congo are interesting and have some historical value as evidence of what this environment looked like in 1930 the shots of the pygmies and other natives are also interesting although these suffer from the johnsons' penchant to stage events in a manner that makes the natives look 'wild' and alien the best and funniest scene in 'congorilla' is an improvised sequence in which osa johnson attempts to teach a jazz dance to some pygmy women the dance is the black bottom no less the same dance which bob hope famously taught to daisy and violet hilton the conjoined twins wearing jodhpurs riding boots and a pith helmet osa johnson starts scat singing while she does high steps and slaps her knees in her attempt to teach this dance to the african women meanwhile they just stand there staring at her apparently wondering what this crazy white woman is trying to accomplish it's a very funny scene but it has unpleasant undertones osa johnson is doing a dance that was invented by black americans the implication seems to be that black africans should instinctively be able to perform this dance after a brief demonstration using natural rhythm i guess because it's in their blood or something i'll rate 'congorilla' 4 points out of 10 this film says a little bit about african life in the 1930s and rather more about american cultural perceptions in that same decade	negative
this super creepy southern gothic melodrama stars clint eastwood as a wounded confederate officer in the civil war who's taken in by a rural girls' school and nursed back to health a weird clash of genders ensues with the supposedly dangerous male falling prey to a batch of seemingly harmless women who prove themselves to be every bit as brutal as the men waging war on one another at the battle fronts this is a classic spider and the fly story but here there's one lone fly and a whole bunch of spiders geraldine page plays the head mistress of the school and she gives a characteristically sensational performance page was trained as a theater actress and it shows in all of her performances no matter what role she played she always committed herself 100 to it and never once let herself drop out of character so it is here with this lethal spinster who takes her sexual repression out on this helpless man each of the other girls responds to him in her own particular way as well the two most prominent are the slutty girl who can't wait to throw throw herself at him and the virginal one played by who else but the mannered elizabeth hartman who acts like she would fall over in a dead faint if someone so much as said the word penis to her the schematic madonna and the whore storyline would seem heavy handed if the movie didn't keep you so off kilter and so completely unsure of what was going to happen next the most memorable scene in the film for me occurred when the group of women perform an amputation of eastwood's leg which has become infected with gangrene again the spider fly allusion is clear they hobble him so that it's that much harder for him to escape their web a classic chiller not a great film but a morbidly entertaining one grade a	positive
a girl named isobel becomes possessed by a demon the local priest who formerly dated isobel's sister must try to save her but the bigger problems are with the family's suspicions of each other rather than the demon in their daughter this film is directed by ethan wiley the writer of house and the writer director of house ii i loved the first film and liked the second one even better so you would think this would be a winner alas this one looks like it was thrown together by first year film students dawson leery could have done better i have thought about blaming new writer ellary eddy especially because the idea is hardly original are they trying to cash in on the fans of the exorcism of emily rose but wiley should have been able to do his magic also you'd like to think veteran horror stars jeffrey combs and james russo would help this film russo playing the bishop barely shows up and combs has a great role as a sheriff for the five minutes he's on screen but i love the mustache so no help here after seeing the exorcist all other exorcism films must be compared to the classic by default no and the demonic possession in this film was not scary in the least no head spinning or paranormal activity at all just a girl with a deep voice and runny makeup all the demonic stuff was centered around the father accusing everyone of sleeping with his wife as another reviewer wrote you get a lot of isobel bouncing on her bed like it's a trampoline hiding in her closet and jumping from a hay loft yeah it's chuck e cheese gone wild that sadly sums up the extent of the evil in this movie if you want to watch a movie about family members who invent accusations and yell at each other while the possessed daughter sits in another room off camera this is the movie for you but if you don't mind my saying so you have a horrible taste in film if this is what you're seeking the plot seems to focus on the father accusing a cowboy of sleeping with his wife who didn't but did sleep with his daughter and of the veterinarian of sleeping with his wife who might have but denies it and then you have a gardener who attacks the possessed girl with a crucifix and tells the family to call an exorcist but once the priest arrives the gardener declares he does not believe in god what was all the bible quoting you were doing five minutes ago a horrible exorcism movie horribler examples of what combs and russo are capable of and such a sad display of directing after the house series of films became classic i would like to pretend wiley had no part in making this shamefully derivative and unoriginal uninspired film the power of christ compels you to avoid this movie as if viewing it were a cardinal sin	negative
a woman sylvia kristel seduces a 15 year old boy eric brown they have sex but it's all tied into some stupid plot or something easily one of the most disturbing sex comedies ever does anyone realize this movie is making light of child molestation i suppose it's ok cause it's a teenage boy if we had one with a man seducing a teenage girl there would rightfully be outrage sorry but having it done to a boy doesn't excuse it it's still sick i realize brown was of age he was actually 18 when this was made but he looks 15 i just find it disturbing that some people find this ok plot aside the acting sucks kristel is beautiful but can't act brown is easily one of the worst child actors i've ever seen and the constant nudity gets boring and isn't even remotely erotic i saw this drivel at a theatre back in 1981 i was 19 and with my 14 year old cousin who could easily pass for 18 he wanted to see it i didn't but i decided what the heck we got in and i actually bought tickets for three teenage boys who were obviously underage my cousin thought is was boring and the three other kids left halfway through let me make this clear three teenage boys left a movie with tons of female nudity that should give you an idea of how bad this is i'm surprised this was ever released a 1 all the way	negative
extremities aspect ratio 1 85 1 sound format mono a woman turns the tables on a would be rapist when he mounts an assault in her home and is forced to decide whether to kill him or inform the police in which case he could be released and attack her again exploitation fans who might be expecting another rough 'n' ready rape fantasy in the style of day of the woman 1978 will almost certainly be disappointed by extremities true farrah fawcett's character is subjected to two uncomfortably prolonged assaults before gaining the upper hand on her attacker a suitably slimy james russo but scriptwriter william mastrosimone and director robert m young take these unpleasant scenes only so far before unveiling the dilemma which informs the moral core of this production would their final solution hold up in a court of law maybe based on a stage play which reportedly left its actors battered and bruised after every performance the film makes no attempt to open up the narrative and relies instead on a confined setting for the main action acing and technical credits are fine though fawcett's overly subdued performance won't play effectively to viewers who might be relying on her to provide an outlet for their outraged indignation	negative

i have enjoyed criminal intent series of law and order for a long time kathryn erbe det alexandra eames the female detective is rather hard and seems a bit bitter in the criminal intent series see her other side in this movie this movie shows the marvelous soft side of this talented actresses and if you are a criminal intent fan this movie is a revelry in her acting and you get a pretty darn good yarn of family hardships in the south i did not like albert finneys role in this movie because he did such a convincing acting job of the older southern fellow that is hard headed and intolerant and unaccepting of change he reminds me of so many men from my youth and the portrayal is divine but you will likely find him hard to like in this movie katryn erbe is easy to like in this movie and why i recommend it as a 10 star for criminal intent law and order fans	positive
just after watching the first one and it is very dumb i happened to watch an episode of bones first and then the eleventh hour the 11th hour should be embarrassed it is so weak stewart introduces himself as a government scientist no mention of what kind of scientist just general sciency stuff in a program about cloning they bring a caretaker who was paid to dispose unsuccessful embryos to a church and made him kneel before the statue of jesus on the cross and ask forgiveness and as well tell them where the bad guy is so as they can move the plot on now thats science at work there is a dumb not good dumb bit where picard rages at a tv that advertises skin scream that makes you look younger shouting it's a lie as his randy female assistant gets groped by the local hot bobbie next door the end of the first episode is like a bad cartoon where the bad old lady named after pinnochios daddy in order to move the clunky plot along waves at picard from the street as she gets in a taxi picard is one floor up and he looks out a window wistfully going she got away he could like try to run down or maybe ring the cops or maybe get the number of the taxi and ring it in or maybe had anything other than i am waving and getting into a taxi now and there is nothing you can do about it until next week ending mahhahahahah pity it's so stupid at one point a grieving father is convinced by picard that even if a replica clone son was born it would never be his son as his son had a soul yes that's right folks the general scientist argues against cloning on the basis that every soul is unique and sure why else would you want to clone although the general scientist picard finds cloning a bit gooey he's all up for stem cell research and goes as far as to say that calamity will befall humanity if it isn't allowed he has a pretty strident rant about how important it is of course he doesn't mention a single example that kind of sums up the show buzz words and tawdriness	negative

the first time i saw this movie was on a flight between guangzhou china and los angeles it was a real hoot and made the trip pass with much less discomfort than the normal 10 hour flight i tried to locate a copy of it without success until i discovered a copy for sale on ebay having now watched it twice i recommend it as good entertainment my only real criticisms are that the choice of english translation words for the subtitles is sub par even by normal standards also the subtitling is little to small blends into the movie too often and frequently travels too fast to read well	positive
as a dane i'm proud of the handful of good danish movies that have been produced in recent years it's a terrible shame however that this surge in quality has led the majority of danish movie critics to lose their sense of criticism in fact it has become so bad that i no longer trust any reviews of danish movies and as a result i have stopped watching them in theaters i know it's wrong to hold this unfortunate development against any one movie so let me stress that villa paranoia would be a terrible film under any circumstances the fact that it was hyped by the critics just added fuel to my bonfire of disillusionment with danish film furthermore waiting until it came out on dvd was very little help against the unshakable feeling of having wasted time and money erik clausen is an accomplished director with a knack for social realism in copenhagen settings i particularly enjoyed de frigjorte 1993 as an actor he is usually funny though he generally plays the same role in all of his movies namely that of a working class slob who's down on his luck partly because he's a slob but mostly because of society and who redeems himself by doing something good for his community this is problem number one in villa paranoia clausen casts himself as a chicken farmer which is such a break from the norm that he never succeeds in making it credible it is much worse however that the film has to make twists and turns and break all rules of how to tell a story to make the audience understand what is going on for instance the movie opens with a very sad attempt at visualizing the near death experience of the main character with the use of low budget effects and bad camera work after that the character tells her best friend that she suddenly felt the urge to throw herself off a bridge this is symptomatic of the whole movie there is little or no motivation for the actions of the characters and clausen resorts to the lowest form of communicating whatever motivation there is telling instead of showing thus at one point you have a character talking out loud to a purportedly catatonic person about the way he feels because the script wouldn't allow him to act out his feelings and later on voice over is abruptly introduced quite possibly as an afterthought to convey feelings that would otherwise remain unknown to the audience due to the director's ineptitude fortunately at this point you're roughly an hour past caring about any of the characters let alone the so called story the acting which has frequently been a problem in clausen's movies can be summed up in one sad statement søren westerberg bentsen whose only other claim to stardom was as a contestant on big brother is no worse than several of the heralded actors in the cast i give this a 2 out of 10 rating	negative

this is one to watch a few times the excellent writing shows they had to have lived this story or know someone whom did because they nailed it freebird made me relive and laugh at my misspent youth the title was a great choice great film setting story soundtrack and characters it's a biker flick but would be a shame to pigeon hole it that way funny to the bone kinda like trailer park boys in the u k if you've never seen tpb make a point to if you like this film you will thank me i hope to see more of these characters in other films sequel could be done there's a whole lot more of the world i would like to see through their eyes	positive
it holds very true to the original manga of the same name aka tramps like us in the u s but it can still be enjoyed even if you haven't read the manga it's a different kind of tail showing a strong and independent woman who hurts just like everyone else however because of her outward strength she fears showing her inner feelings and thus let's those around her hurt her with their blunt comments the only one who truly figures her out and who she can be at ease with is her new pet human momo if you want something different than the normal boring stuff with some wonderful j dorama japanese drama actors resses then this is definitely the series to watch and read	positive
yet again early morning television proves an invaluable resource for films that i otherwise would never have been able to track down at four o'clock in the morning i stumbled out of bed to begin recording 'the informer 1935 ' my fourth film from prolific american director john ford and an excellent one at that set during the irish civil war in 1922 the screenplay was adapted by dudley nichols from the novel of the same name by liam o'flaherty though he was born in the united states and is most renowned for his americana pictures both of ford's parents were irish which explains the director's decision to direct the film victor mclaglen plays gypo nolan a brutish but well meaning ruffian who informs on an old friend frankie mcphillip wallace ford in order to claim the 20 reward for his girlfriend katie margot grahame when frankie is killed during his attempted arrest the irish republican army of which both frankie and gypo were members begins to investigate the traitor behind the incident every clue bringing them closer and closer to the real culprit meanwhile gypo is plagued with guilt for his friend's untimely death and descends into a bout of heavy drinking that rivals don birnam in 'the lost weekend 1945 ' in its excessiveness as gypo drowns his sorrows in copious volumes of alcohol trapped in a vicious little circle of depression his extravagant spending captures the attention of the investigating ira members for the one time in his life gypo finds himself surrounded by admirers including an amusing j m kerrigan who enthusiastically clap him on the back and christen him king gypo for his physical might however it's obvious that these people feel no affection for the man and are simple showing him attention to exploit him for money the additional 20 brought by frankie's death could never buy gypo an assembly of friends indeed in a bitter twist of irony the money was only made possible by the betrayal and loss of one of his only good companions a relatively simple fellow gypo could not possibly have fully considered the consequences of his actions and is eventually offered forgiveness on account of his not knowing what he was doing but his foolishness must not go unpunished criticism is occasionally levelled at ford's film for its allegedly propagandistic support of a terrorist organisation though this stance obviously depends on one's personal views i certainly don't know enough irish history to pass judgement there's no doubt that the film portrays the irish republican army as selfless dedicated and impartial a proud piece of irish patriotism if i ever saw it however the main theme of the story is that of betrayal driven by intense poverty one ordinary man betrays the confidence of his good friend and comes to deeply regret his actions the tormented gypo is played mainly for pity and victor mclaglen gives a powerful performance that betrays a lifetime of unsatisfying existence culminating in one terrible decision that condemns him to an uneasy death 'the informer' was john ford's first major oscar success winning a total of four awards from six nominations including best actor for mclaglen who snatched the statue from the three way favourites of 'mutiny on the bounty 1935 ' best director and best screenplay for dudley nichols who declined the award due to union disagreements	positive
if this film were to be rated on a scale of 1 to 10 one would need to create a new rating system as this one should not even qualify the film's plot if you can call it that revolves around charlie stephen baldwin an ex special operatives agent who is being targeted by the brother of a man he killed while he was still working for the us gov't if this sounds like an interesting scenario please don't be fooled as this film will not deliver that which its action themed story suggests comedian chris rock once said that when one sees an actor doing a bad film that it makes one want to send the actor 50 given that the actor must be desperate for money to be doing such poor quality work after watching this film you may want to send stephen baldwin 100 it appears that baldwin did not put any effort into his role in the film in the film baldwin is forced to run all over the city of los angeles in order to protect his honeycomb wife from being murdered by the brother of a man he previously killed however throughout the picture it appears that baldwin can barely pull off maintaining a light jog his laid back performance succeeds in subtracting from any suspense that the film might have intended to portray if you are the type of person who enjoys watching very bad films and laughing at their shortcomings than this film is for you however if you are looking for a well made action thriller it would be best to look somewhere else rather than renting this film	negative
anyone can make a movie these days budget production value or experienced crew don't have to stop the self described director from realizing their dream these days respect for the craft of film making or even just respect for any film aesthetic are no longer prerequisites for actually executing a film director bill cowell must have thought he struck gold when lion's gate decided to market his original film as a sequel to a film he had nothing to do with i personally find lion's gate far far more in error than cowell in regard to dark harvest 2 being made available to the public lion's gate's deceptive marketing of this film should be investigated by the state attorney general's office and lion's gate's officers should be pickled in sulfuric acid and kerosene for their utter disregard for film film making and good sense as for the film itself it's not even worth commenting on	negative
this film is a total bore entrapment is way better in all aspects plot acting stunts etc plus the soundtrack is one of the most annoying i've ever heard i was close to muting the film just to shut it up 3 out of 10 stars	negative
i expected so much more than what i received from watching this movie it is not that i object to literary license if that is what it should be called especially when there is no overt attempt to say based on a true story but this movie is about beethoven a real historical person who is so widely known and so deeply embedded into our musical experiences and i expected the movie to be true to history at least in the primary elements this movie took such great exception from the historic record it could only disappoint my assumption because i had not researched the movie at all was that it was true half way through i stopped the movie to look it up on imdb the rest of the movie was a remarkably different experience i was relieved that this was not accurate with history because it was so hard to believe a major portion of the story to enjoy this movie i was required to recognize it as a fantasy a what if it was like this story the movie lacked this honest disclaimer what disappointed me most was the fictionalized conducting of the 9th symphony the very concept portrayed in the film stretched my imagination to the point of incredulity i ended up doubting anything was true to history other than ludwig van beethoven and his relationship with karl van beethoven i really enjoyed the performance of ed harris an exceptional actor who knows how to play a role and keep himself out of it and that was about it and for that i give it a 3 10 those who portend that this movie is as good as or better than amadeus have not a clue about either either composers life and are looking only for what this movie really is for in the end it was a cheap novel of a story pulp fiction	negative
the pilot of enterprise has one thing that has been lacking since the original star trek a dose of realistic flawed personalities the utopian characters of the next generation got tiring they were so noble as to be unbelievable i also like the sub plot that humans are bitter toward the vulcans its funny seeing them as pretentious snobs it makes me look forward to seeing when the humans become the dominant race between the two though i don't think it would work in the time frame of the show the only negatives that jumped out at me were the quick cut off the ending at 2 hours feel of the end which is common among many of the trek shows the second was the shameless dig for ratings by a couple of senselessly sexy scenes it was out of place a good science fiction show should be able to stand on its own without trying to pad the pre teen audience with some skin but its not my job to make the show profitable so oh well lets see how the next episode does	positive
predictable parody just about failed to impress throughout it's looooooong eight minutes the only thing that made it worthwhile was the do not colorize line at the end credits shame something more entertaining wasn't put on the dvd like jonathan ross' enjoyable profile of romero on 'the incredible strange film show '	negative
fellow noir devotees be not deceived this is a stinker poorly filmed poorly acted and there is nothing nothing here for the film buff looking for yet another solid b movie from the goldmine of the 40's 50's era of classics i gave it a try based on the relatively high rating on imdb there's no accounting for taste but i found nothing in this movie to recommend to other imdb members this is a classic example of having watched a movie and feeling like you have been cheated out of x number of minutes that it took the movie to get to its thankful demise to have alan ladd on the cover of the dvd tape is nearly fraud he is on camera less than two minutes and has almost no dialogue this isn't this gun for hire folks it is a classic in the lousy sense of the studios cranking out fodder on no budget we all search for the great ones save your time on gangs inc paper bullets it is lousy	negative
i'm having as much fun reading the user comments as i did watching the movie it seems that this is the classic either love it or hate it movie and i have to say that i not only am on the love it side i'm going on a limb to say it this my favorite movie ever thank heavens i found it in the first place almost impossible to find i was lucky about ten years ago to record it off a late night uhf channel of course my liking of sellers may make me a bit biased but i can't see how anyone with a cornball dry sense of humor like me can not be in love with this flick the plot is great but perhaps as a previous poster said maybe the reason why it's not a widely known movie upset the medical field the acting is great i can see why some may say the acting was horrible but that's what made this movie so great it's total tacky ness and the humor is gut busting i'm proud to say i have watched this film no less than about 20 times and have pretty much every line memorized this film is genius	positive
that's pretty much the whole soundtrack to this film i just saw this baby at the munich film festival and it rocked the house director doug pray is never seen in this documentary nor i think he is even heard but he has done a very intimate look into the lives and history of the mixer he has segmented his film into about eight chapters and then his motley group of enthusiastic interviews will be spiced throughout according to what they are talking about i was never big into scratching but the film does a wonderful job of keeping elementary for those who know little and infusing in jokes for those who are experts themselves in this area mix master mike from the beastie boys is in this film but it wasn't until after the film that i could name several heavy hitters in the industry dj shadow q bert etc the extreme fascination for turntables by these talented and quirky djs is evident in their explanations of what their music means to them the film also sheds some gratifying light on these guys and one woman to be classified as musicians pray doesn't let his film idle and if there exists a slow scene it is soon re energized by hardly ever ceasing music if nothing else this film will increase your slang vocabulary i have to get back to digging so i'll end this review see it it will be of interest good stuff man good stuff	positive
this movie is one of my all time favorites i think that sean penn did a great job acting it is one of the few true stories that made it to film that i really like it is in my top 10 films of all time i watch it over and over and never get tired of it great movie	positive
chesty gringo telly savalas as frank cooper is a us mexico border cop he serves as a father figure to young immigrant danny de la paz as benny romero who wants mr savalas to be best man at his impending wedding savalas is tough but boss eddie albert as commander moffat may be tougher tough is what you need to stop smuggler michael v gazzo as chico suarez alliances may be in flux if you find the possibility of hearing kojak and oliver douglas uttering expletives to be repulsive you ought to steer clear of the border if not you may not have the stomach for the realistic cow slaughtering scene although it doesn't end up being worth much mr de la paz and cecilia camacho as leina steal the show the border 1979 tony richardson telly savalas danny de la paz eddie albert	negative
the saucy misadventures of four au pairs who arrive in london on the same day in the early 1970s there's a swedish girl a danish a german and a chinese the story contrives to get the clothes off all of them involve them in some carry on type humour and couple them with various misfits from the british film and tv culture of the time including man about the house star richard o'sullivan future coronation street rogue johnny briggs and horror film stalwart ferdy mayne playing a sheik there's a pretty risqué amount of female nudity on display for those who like that kind of thing but obviously nothing hardcore most of the film is pretty thin and inconsequential the girls are stereotypes and german anita especially suffers from some kind of infantalising disorder she's a moron obsessed with colour tv who acts like a kind of uninhibited child dresses to deliberately show her private parts in another more serious film she would be a psychiatric case the most interesting section of the film involves the swedish girl being taken to a club in london where some dodgy types are still trying to swing being seduced by a middle aged rocker losing her virginity and realising that the scene is not for her these sequences have some energy in them and point to a more intriguing film than we've ended up with in which promiscuity and the dregs of the music business and upper classes live soulless and seedy lives there's a fine turn by john standing as an impotent public school roué the strangest of the stories has the chinese girl future cannibal film veteran me me lay getting off with her childish piano prodigy employer falling mutually in love with and then leaving in the middle of the night for no good reason at all except some orientalist notion that chinese birds are inscrutable ain't they the film is pretty demeaning to its women characters and there's a smattering of homophobia in the dialogue and one of the characterisations the end is striking as mayne's sheik for no earthly reason except they have to end the film somehow whisks all of the girls away to his arab kingdom for what looks to all the world like a future in the white slave trade which they are all delighted about stuff and nonsense for the most part then but directed with a fair amount of skill by veteran val guest which puts it as a piece of film making a notch above most of the 70s brit sexploitation flicks	negative
richard brooks' the last hunt was a film star stewart granger couldn't even stand to hear mentioned he even tore up a vintage poster for the film when presented it for signing in his later years but then the director did run off with his wife so it's understandable for anyone else this is one of the best of the adult westerns of the 50s and years ahead of its time in its attitude to the environment in many ways it plays almost like a sequel to one of anthony mann's westerns that see their heroes dragged to their redemption kicking and screaming against it every step in the way here granger's legendary buffalo hunter has already seen the light but after a buffalo stampede costs him his herd of cattle in a fit of poetic justice he's dragged back into the darkness by robert taylor's callous and proudly racist gunslinger justifying it on the grounds that i've already got the guilty conscience i might as well have the money as well raised by indians he's fully aware of the damage he's doing as the disappearing buffalo heads for extinction and he gradually becomes almost as consumed with self loathing as taylor is with hate when the two men fall out over debra paget's squaw the sole survivor of a band of indians taylor kills and a white buffalo hide that's priceless to the hunters and the indians for very different reasons a showdown becomes inevitable though the outcome certainly isn't taylor's is certainly ironic casting it was granger turning down many of the epic roles mgm developed for him in films like quo vadis and ivanhoe that gave taylor his 50s comeback after years of steady decline his hair color may not convince but his performance does a shallow and violent man so consumed with hate that he doesn't wear a gun the gun wears him granger's accent isn't always convincing but he makes a good quiet hero in the jimmy stewart mold trying to keep hold of his newfound decency and reconcile his actions with his beliefs before finally getting a chance to make amends russ tamblyn's halfbreed skinner and lloyd nolan's one legged old timer also give as good as they get but the real star is the script tightly plotted with an excellent eye and ear for character not to mention an ending stanley kubrick borrowed for the shining it balances historical revisionism with entertaining drama without ever selling either short the new french dvd is extras free but does boast a 2 35 1 transfer with an english soundtrack	positive
this is the worst film i have ever seen and what disappoints me the most is that this is yash raj film so at first when you see the promos you think yes thats definitely another yash raj hit but when you see the film your eyes will water with disappoint the storyline is stupid and dumb we've seen it many times boy is soon to marry and falls in love with a girl blah blah blah if you do see this pathetic film don't go with you family there is too much exposure and kiss scene i don even see why you would go to see it on your own overall this is a disgraceful disgusting and anything else which is bad and starts with a d film don't go to see it you'll end up hating yash ji and yash raj films	negative
despite looking dated inki and the minah bird is my opinion an enjoyable and charming cartoon the artwork isn't extraordinary but good enough this cartoon has no dialogs just sounds and music but this combination works out pretty well the cartoon itself is good funny old fashioned creative entertaining and amusing this cartoon also makes the difference because it focus in just 3 characters inki the little black girl the minah bird a very strange bird and a hungry lion that wants to have both inki and minah for breakfast so he chases them both during most of the cartoon i actually find that lion very handsome hilarious and cool i really like that lion that poor lion is so silly and loser that you have to feel sorry for him for me the real enemy is the minah bird not the lion at one point the lion almost eats it too bad he doesn't get to gulp it because it deserved to be eaten back to this animated short there isn't a single dull or boring moment at least for me the only bit that i find stupid is the ending because the bird has a major fight with the lion steals his teeth and puts them on itself other than that i have nothing major to criticize about this aside the fact that the steak should've definitely have gone for the lion and not the bird in my opinion this is a very forgotten and underrated little jewel that should definitely get more credit	positive
